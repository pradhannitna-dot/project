"I needed a pad for a temporary bladder leakage and since the old type pads that were used with a sanitary belt (yep, I'm that old) haven't been made in decades and would be the ideal resolution, I went looking for something that would suffice for small bladder leakage problems. Since I used to use Always products years ago, and after researching several pad options, I thought this would be a great way to protect my clothing should an instance occur. Well, when I opened the package and opened one of the pads I was really surprised. These pads are huge in length, but are good in width. except that I have to cut off the bottom 2 inches of the pad at the fold when you open it unless you want to use it for night time urine protection. I bought these for the thickness and for the ""wings"" but the only problem is that there is virtually little to no adhesion! I have to use a small safety pin in the front to attach the pad to my underware. Kind of defeats the purpose. For now, they will suffice.

"I hate that I have to write a negative review for a product I've used and never used to have issues with for years, I've been using this brand since I first got my period over 10 years ago and I never used to have a problem but ever since they updated the design/formula I've been having more leakage and problems ever since. It feels like a cheap copy of the product I used to love.As someone who has always experienced period anxiety the change in these pads makes it so much worse, I feel like I'm going through pads more often because I don't feel the secureness I used to. So much for the leak guard I've leaked or almost leaked through more of these new pads than I've ever done in my entire life & especially at night!, I don't know what exactly is going on with the wings but I feel like that is half the problem and leakage from the side is more than likely to happen. Along with this god awful new design at the bottom and top of the pads where the pad itself (the absorbant part) is no longer rounded ???? Who thought that was a good idea?!?! This also restricts people on the way that they can wear them I know many people including myself that have worn them backwards/upside down/the wrong way up in the past for whatever reason because why would I want what should be the bottom end at the top because there's a like split in it ???? and the other end is pointed like WHY??? It feels like there's less of a pad because of it!I also have had issues with the stickiness of the pads themselves, the wings hardly stick at all and the pad itself is either too sticky or not sticky enough. Literally what is going on ??? The fact I've been using this new formula for months and it's gotten to the point I've had to write a review really says everything.I swear every time I buy a new packet the amount I get is less and less (started with 32 then 24 and now 22!!), I know this is captalism but like with the quality change and the fact I feel like I'm going through more pads because of it because I don't feel safe to last as long as I usually word because the leak guard isn't as good it's a joke. My period isn't getting shorter or lighter by you putting less pads in a packet. Bring back the 32 pack that was great amount for me personally, 22 isn't enough! I know it shouldn't matter given the fact I'm getting 4 boxes of 22 pads but I used to be able to go through only 1 packet of 32 per period now because of the quality change & drop in pads I'm going through almost 1 and 1/2 to almost instead. At the same price!Literally the only reason my rating isn't lower is because I do still use them and I do have somewhat a decent experience despite all this, being able to buy a multipack of 4 is a great thing and I feel like saves money in the long run, and I still do find them comfortable (for a pad) given my sensory issues. It's just a shame that they decided to change something (or a lot of things really) that didn't really need fixing. & I've heard it's not just the ultra pads that have these issues it's most if not all the other versions of always pads.",3.0 out of 5 stars,2025-11-18 00:00:00,"Always Ultra Sanitary Towels, Size 2 Long, Extra Large Pack, 88 Count, Super Absorbent, Ultra Thin Pads with Wings for Moderate Flow","I hate that I have to write a negative review for a product I've used and never used to have issues with for years, I've been using this brand since I first got my period over 10 years ago and I never used to have a problem but ever since they updated the design/formula I've been having more leakage and problems ever since.

"The Real-World ContextFor those of us with exceptionally heavy cycles or who work demanding shift patterns, disposable products are a necessity. On my heaviest days, I frequently ""double up"" on solutions to stay secure.

Great!!! I've been buying this product on subscription for a couple of years. I don't have to worry as the quality is great. It has become expensive over the time but I guess that's to be expected.

Hmmm since I started using these I found my period cramps are much better I'm not finding any sensitivity and no soreness like regular pads.

"I love the Mooncup brand and regularly use their cups, but sometimes I prefer wearing a pad, so I was eager to try these.

So worth it for the comfort and massive reduction in plastic waste!They definitely absorb more than even the biggest disposable pad. Almost makes your flow appear lighter.They don't leak and are easy to use out and about with the wet bag.If you're at all sceptical then just wear them in the house at first to get used to them, and if you're worried when using themOut the house for the first time, either combine with tampons initially or just bring disposables as back ups.I don't think you'll regret giving them a go.Just make sure you have good fitting underwear when wearing the smaller pads as they can move around a bit.",use for a second month now no problem at all on my heavy day i have wear a tampon for part of the day but to be honest that be just in case i think next month i will not bother i have get 2 pack of the large size a pack of medium and one pack of light plenty to get through the 5/6 day for i 😊 .i rinse they until the water pretty much run clear and they then either go straight in a wash or in a wet bag until i put a wash on yes you have to rinse and squeeze out blood which on heavy day be not the most pleasant job but it really do not take long so worth it for the comfort and massive reduction in plastic waste!they definitely absorb more than even the big disposable pad almost make your flow appear light they do not leak and be easy to use out and about with the wet bag if you be at all sceptical then just wear they in the house at first to get use to they and if you be worried when use themout the house for the first time either combine with tampon initially or just bring disposable as back up i do not think you will regret give they a go just make sure you have good fitting underwear when wear the small pad as they can move around a bit,,,2021-03-27,0.9519630074501038,0.9989738464355469,0.9989738464355469,-0.03700035810470581,0.9049521684646606,0.9456349015235901,0.003401339054107666,2,1,1,2,1,1,2
"Purchased these sanitary pads as was looking for something comfortable and to stop buying disposable pads. The pretty dark design is nice and discreet and they fit into panties well and secure easily in place with the popper. Like the little bag to store them in until they are ready to be washed, as keeps odours and mess at bay. The pads are easy to clean, just rinse and then put them in the washing machine. These pads are fine for light to medium days, but found they are not great for heavy flow as advertised, as they are a bit short in length and not wide enough which causes pad to leak slightly. Also for particularly heavy flow they could definitely benefit from being longer in length and wider at the back to save any leakages. Will look to buy some more reusable pads which are longer and wider for those heavier days and nights. Overall happy with purchase.

"I was a bit hesitant making the move from disposables to reusables, but based on previous reviews I decided to give Eco Lily a go. I purchased one pack in my first order (3x large & 3x medium), which were so good that I immediately ordered another 6x medium & 6x light pads. The large and medium are very good, super absorbent and very comfortable. They fit and stay in place perfectly and hold a lot more than disposable pads. I am a lot more confident wearing these cloth pads that haven't leaked once, (compared to disposables that would leak on occasion and you'd often feel like you to need pop to the bathroom to 'go and check'). The first time I wore one I thought it felt a bit bulkier than a disposable, but I very soon got used to it and decided that I preferred this extra feeling of comfort and confidence that I was well covered anyway.That said, the small/light pads are not as good. They are still very absorbent, but they do not stay in place as well as the medium/large. Probably because they are smaller and have less 'bulk/length' behind them to stop them sliding up/down your underwear with just the popper behind it. I did have to keep pulling it up every time I went to the bathroom. I have decided to use the large/medium most of the time and only use the light for the last very light day as just a back-up.

The pads are easy to clean and I will probably invest in some more next month so I have 2 sets to use. I wish I had found this product years ago. Looking forward to saving money in the future and helping to save the planet.",i have be think of try a reusable pad for some time but be totally clueless which brand to try i can across these whilst isolate have get covid my time of the month happen early than expect and i keep forget to add some sanitary towel to my supermarket delivery i order these on amazon as they have next day delivery and i be about to run out when they arrive i be a bit anxious about a reusable pad but then think it be no different to a terry type nappy we wear as baby so would be fine i give it a try think i be not leave home for a while so could quickly shower if there be a problem with leakage however i be extremely surprised how absorbent the pad be it also feel soft warm and fluffy rather than the horrible cold plastic which often make you feel sore the pad be easy to clean and i will probably invest in some more next month so i have 2 set to use i wish i have find this product year ago look forward to save money in the future and help to save the planet,,,2022-02-03,-0.012781083583831787,0.9949636459350586,,-0.9961307942867279,,,0.9949636459350586,2,1,0,2,0,0,1

"I've been trying to make eco-friendlier choices in all aspects of my life and had in the past used organic cotton sanitary pads. But I decided to try the reusable washable pads, even if it was just for the evenings and the heavier days at home.I've been using these and they're great. Unlike normal san-pro - you don't feel any liquid in fact the material draws the blood away from the surface and you feel dry. I've used two towels in a day, much less than I'd use with the ordinary towels.The only minus is that as other reviewers have said, it feels like they need an extra popper underneath and it can feel a bit bulky, but not seriously uncomfortable - perhaps undies which are a bit tighter would be better when wearing these. I don't think I'll be wearing them under my leggings at the gym, but for everyday use, under jeans etc, I wouldn't have a problem.As regards cleaning, it's pretty easy, just rinse them out and wash them without fabric softener.

"Im new to the reuseable sanitary market and having used these for two cycles now I can completely say without hesitation that I'm a convert.My first 3 days are always very heavy and I must admit on my first cycle I decided to double up with a tampon during a trip to the cinema (I usually soak through a tampon within 2hrs during day 2) as I was fearful of making a terrible mistake and having to deal with leaks on seats and bloody crack marks on my jeans etc. However the rest of my cycles have been a breeze. If anything there is something odly comforting about the fleecy-ness.

"Was not sure whether to purchase these but wanted to reduce the wastage from using disposable pads every month. I am so glad I bought these pads , took a while to get used to . I would suggest some snug fitting stretchy pants as they do move around abit. I like wearing loose fitting underwear but found the pads slid from back to front abit so went out to get some 'snuggier' pants and that solved the problem. The panty liner types are very absorbent . I also bought the medium and large pads for the monthlies and found them to be extremely absorbent, more so than disposable pads . No leakage at all. The sizes would be the same as disposable panty liners/ menstrual pads . I found that I don't need to change them as often as I would if I were using disposable ones. They are easy to clean , I usually give them a rinse when I'm in the shower and throw them into a bucket ready to go into the washing machine. They dry very quickly as well ready for the next use. Have bought a box of six panty liners and a box of three medium and three large pads and found them enough usage for both my daughter and I at this moment . If not I would not hesitate to buy some more. She is absolutely loving them as well , especially the fact that they are saving the planet . In the long run it saves on money and reducing the waste going into landfill sites. If you are unsure I wouldn't hesitate , just buy some and save your purse and the planet !

"This is my second set of reusable pads so I knew what to expect, still having a few of the old ones the difference was easy to see immediately.

"I have really appreciated these as a much better solution to feminine hygiene than conventional disposables. They don't stick painfully to you, don't need endlessly reordering, and are effective and generally really easy to handle.They wear well. I brought some almost three years ago and am only just starting to think about getting a new set. I did have to sew up a loose seam on one shortly after purchase but I have had no other issues with them needing repair or wearing out.The only problem I've had is that they do slide backwards and forwards in looser fitting underwear. On the whole, however, I would have said I have had less leaking with these than using disposables: they scrunch up less and have good absorbancy.To launder them, I generally put them through a low temperature delicates' wash without any sort of soap or other product (not because they are delicate, but for the clean cold water soak), and then I wash them again at 40C with my cottons (and my ordinary washing detergent). They have been quite happy with this treatment and look totally unused - no staining or unsavoury smell or anything - when it is finished.Given that they are durable and don't need a lot of elaborate or high temperature cleaning, they are almost certainly more ecological than disposables in the vast majority of circumstances.

"Why has it taken me until I'm 46 to discover these?! I only have a few years left before my periods come to a natural end - all those years of horrible environment destroying disposable pads and tampons - I'm both ashamed of myself for not using these sooner but also frustrated that these aren't being sold in mainstream stores and advertised on tv like they should be. They are super comfortable, super absorbent and leak proof and super great for the environment. I actually found them because I'm peri-menopausal and have been getting unmanageable heavy flooding that disposable pads have been useless for. In desperation for a solution I came across these. They are not as bulky to wear as they look and are so comfortable you don't notice they are there. Once you've got the hang of how to manage them (which is honestly not as hard as it looks) there is no going back. I shove them in the washing machine on a rinse cycle before putting them in the wash with the rest of my clothes (take that as a tip - you'd be amazed at how much blood they absorb), and then put them in the airing cupboard or on a radiator to dry (they take a while to completely dry out) - and then all good to go.

"So I was a little reluctant about these but wanted to do something for the environment. The biggest question I had was what do I do with the wet ones after I've rinsed them and before I am planning to wash them - I assumed they would get smelly if left half full of water. Sooo I cheated a little - I don't know if this is fully advised, but I had 1 pack of the big ones and 1 pack of the small ones, and I just folded them up and put them in the wet bag after I was done with them, and I didn't actually rinse them till the end of my period. I didn't notice any smell from them in this time, in fact I only noticed the smell when I unfolded them to rinse at the end of the week. I also wasn't quite ready to get my hands dirty, so I had a stick with the round disk on the bottom that I just used to ""beat"" them in the water. The good news is I got all the blood out and left no stains and then washed them and they came out great, smelling clean and all. I don't know if they'll last quite as long my way of doing it, but it saves a little of the uncomfortableness of cleaning them. The one thing I would point out which is kind of a given, but not something I had really thought about prior - if you are transferring from regular pads, remember these ones aren't sticky - they only have the button in the middle, which means the ends can move around a bit. I actually use these with some period pants, because I have quite a heavy flow, and the combination definitely works for me - but make sure you are keeping an eye on where they are sitting.",5.0 out of 5 stars,2020-04-11 00:00:00,Eco Lily Reusable Sanitary Pads (6Pk for Heavy Flow),"So I was a little reluctant about these but wanted to do something for the environment.

"These are fantastic! I was deliberating about getting these for a while but i'm so glad that I did! I bought 2 boxes of the mix packs, which include 3 large and 3 medium sanitary towels, so 6 of each in total. I suffer with PCOS and generally very heavy periods. My periods usually last 7-8 days, so this was a perfect amount of pads for me. They have great absorbency, so I was going through 3-4 disposable sanitary towels a day, I now go through only 2 of these reusables on my heavy days and 1 on the lighter days. I also suffer with very sensitive skin so get very painful rashes from wearing disposable sanitary towels. I don't have any reactions with these which is amaing!! They wash really easily too! Just soak them in cold water in the sink when you take one off and put a new one on, this just gets rid of the worst of the blood and prevents staining. Wring the pad out and place it in the waterproof section of the wash bag they come with! At the end of your period just chuck them all in the washing machine, you can put the bags in too. I washed mine at 40degrees and they came out perfectly clean. Just don't use any fabric softener as this will decrease the absorbency! The only negative thing I have to say for them, is that because there is no sticky side to stick to your knickers, they can move about about a little bit, BUT, very simple solution, I just bought a roll of double sided body tape (or boob tape!) I put a few centimetres of tape at either end of the pad and it doesn't budge at all!!

"I've been using these for a few months now, and they're great! A while ago I switched from disposable pads to fancy (...and expensive) period pants, which still remain my ultimate solution for dealing with my period because of how comfortable they are... but at £20ish a pair I don't want to buy too many of them and I want them to last as long as possible.That's where these sanitary towels come in. They are a bit bulkier than the period pants and slightly prone to move around so I avoid wearing them when I'm being very active, but for overnight or times when I'm just lounging around the house then they are ideal. Comfort-wise I'd rate them slightly above disposable towels - I find the fleecy material is a lot nicer to touch, it doesn't have any adhesive to get stuck where it shouldn't, and there's no noisy plastic packaging to open.I've found washing them to be really easy - I just give them a cold rinse after use and store them up in the supplied wet bag until I'm ready put them through the washing machine on a low temperature. I was worried that the fleece material would end up permanently looking like something from a murder scene after the first use, but they ended up as-new after a go in the washer.EDIT: I went to buy some more of these four years later and found out I'd already left a review!

So as an update, they are still going strong after four years of use and I think I could definitely keep using them, but I figured that the fleece material was perhaps not as soft as it was so I'd get some fresh ones.",i have be use these for a few month now and they be great a while ago i switch from disposable pad to fancy and expensive period pant which still remain my ultimate solution for deal with my period because of how comfortable they be but at £ 20ish a pair i do not want to buy too many of they and i want they to last as long as possible that be where these sanitary towel come in they be a bit bulky than the period pant and slightly prone to move around so i avoid wear they when i be be very active but for overnight or time when i be just lounge around the house then they be ideal comfort wise i would rate they slightly above disposable towel i find the fleecy material be a lot nice to touch it do not have any adhesive to get stick where it should not and there be no noisy plastic packaging to open i've find wash they to be really easy i just give they a cold rinse after use and store they up in the supply wet bag until i be ready put they through the washing machine on a low temperature i be worried that the fleece material would end up permanently look like something from a murder scene after the first use but they end up as new after a go in the washer edit i go to buy some more of these four year later and find out i would already leave a review so as an update they be still go strong after four year of use and i think i could definitely keep use they but i figure that the fleece material be perhaps not as soft as it be so i would get some fresh one,,,2020-09-14,0.9991868138313293,-0.9776263038317362,0.017319709062576294,-0.492208331823349,0.01322251558303833,-0.9727417826652527,-0.9727417826652527,1,3,2,4,2,1,1
"I've had those pads for 1.5 years and they're great for heavy flow. Not perfect but so far the best I've had compared to the most renown period pants and other pads. And great for milder flows.One of the advantages is that only the inner layers are sewn together in the shape of the pad. The outer layer is only sewn to the rest at the edge. This means blood cannot leak via the seams (if that makes sense).I've had leakage very quickly from pads where all of the layers are sewn together for the shape of the pad and it's extremely frustrating as you need to be changing them more often.These ones need changing as often as you would from thick disposable pads if you have really heavy flow, not so often for milder flows.They're soft and absorbant.

"After reading the glowing reviews I invested in a pack of 6 large pads to test at night time. I'm in my 30s and have become sick of the waste and damage to my underwear that disposable ones cause. After my initial trial I was so pleased with the results that I bought 2 more packs, this time mixed packs to use during the day.These are so soft, I'd never noticed before how rough regular sanity pads are. The absorbency is great, I'm amazed how much these things can hold. The only icky thing I needed to get over was rinsing them out after use, but it's a small price to pay for comfy and re useable pads.Other reviewers have noted that these can move a little while wearing them, I have also found this but it's never been a problem for me, they are very easy to slip back into place. I used to find that regular sanity towels would move and flip over so these slipping a bit is not a downside of the product for me.I've changed over to using these day and night, I'm a total convert. Yes there are a little pricy but if they last the 5 years they say they will with proper care then they are a bargain in the long run.Another note I'd like to make is the superb customer service, after purchase I received a message of how to properly care for these which I found incredibly helpful.",5.0 out of 5 stars,2022-01-18 00:00:00,Eco Lily Reusable Sanitary Pads (6Pk for Heavy Flow),"After reading the glowing reviews I invested in a pack of 6 large pads to test at night time.

They don't feel too bulky (for me anyway)The design of them are lovely. Love the pattern and colours. The case for them is ideal if you are out and about.

"I've been using reuseable menstrual products or years now, but mainly the mooncup/ organicup prior to this. The problem was that sometimes I didn't want to go to the hassle of washing out the cup and putting it back in multiple times a day because it got to be a painful process with cramps. So I bought these and now use a mix of both. Wow, I wish i had earlier. They are so soft and comfy, with the poppers fastening pretty well. It's worth mentioning I wear really tight underwear and this stops them slipping. The heavy ones really do absorb loads and are great for the heaviest days.Like someone else said, I rinse mine in the shower and so actually handwash in the shower with bar soap then hang to dry. At the end of my period I'll then put them all in the washing machine for a final wash, and I think this method seems to prevent them wearing out so quickly? It's worth mentioning that I keep them flat while washing, and I never wring then out etc. The bags they come with are fab, the two pockets are great. Got to say, being someone who used a mooncup changing these pads in public toilets is MUCH easier than a mooncup! They fold up nicely into a small square when used (secured with poppers) and you can just stuff them in the wetbag.Got to say I also appreciate the black and grey with the purple design- I don't really want to be walking around with bright coloured pads with twee designs on them as a 32 year old woman!Been using them for about 5 months now and they are still fresh and absorbent.

They fold up nicely into a small square when used (secured with poppers) and you can just stuff them in the wetbag.Got to say I also appreciate the black and grey with the purple design- I don't really want to be walking around with bright coloured pads with twee designs on them as a 32 year old woman!Been using them for about 5 months now and they are still fresh and absorbent. I have the pantyliners too and they can also hold a lot. Let's face it it also feels great knowing you aren't polluting the earth with more disposable crap taking absolute years (if it even does at all?) to breakdown...which for me is the best point 👍",i have be use reuseable menstrual product or year now but mainly the mooncup/ organicup prior to this the problem be that sometimes i do not want to go to the hassle of wash out the cup and put it back in multiple time a day because it get to be a painful process with cramp so i buy these and now use a mix of both wow i wish i have early they be so soft and comfy with the popper fasten pretty well it be worth mention i wear really tight underwear and this stop they slip the heavy one really do absorb load and be great for the heavy day like someone else say i rinse mine in the shower and so actually handwash in the shower with bar soap then hang to dry at the end of my period i will then put they all in the washing machine for a final wash and i think this method seem to prevent they wear out so quickly it be worth mention that i keep they flat while washing and i never wring then out etc the bag they come with be fab the two pocket be great got to say be someone who use a mooncup change these pad in public toilet be much easy than a mooncup they fold up nicely into a small square when use secure with popper and you can just stuff they in the wetbag got to say i also appreciate the black and grey with the purple design- i do not really want to be walk around with bright colour pad with twee design on they as a 32 year old woman!been use they for about 5 month now and they be still fresh and absorbent i have the pantyliner too and they can also hold a lot let us face it it also feel great know you be not pollute the earth with more disposable crap take absolute year if it even do at all to breakdown which for i be the good point 👍,,,2021-08-12,0.3899124463399251,0.9998311996459961,0.006604939699172974,-0.9131797850131989,-0.9827688336372375,,-0.993017315864563,3,1,2,2,1,0,1
"When I first tried these I thought ""ok they are super bulky and this feels weird!!"" But and a big BUT, you will never feel safer.

My periods have always been super heavy. I used to use to go through a combination sanitary towels and tampons for the very heaviest bleeding very frequently in the first couple of days of my periods and still leak 😞.Although I still have to change these frequently during the 1st couple of days of my period, i do so less frequently and no longer needs tampons as well as sanitary towels. I have saved an absolute fortune in sanitary protection, not to mention the eco benefits for the environment.I'd say the design of this product is a spark of genius. Good for your pocket and the environment.The only slight criticism I'd have is that if your underwear is not snug and secure, the towel is likely to slip and slide. The seller does recommend using snug fitting lycra / cotton underwear with a wider gusset. I would definitely suggest doing this if you move about a lot.This product gets 10 starts out of 5 from me.

"This is the third different brand of cloth sanitary pads that I've bought and it's definitely my favourite. I've been using cloth pads for a couple of years now and wish I'd discovered these earlier. Here's my breakdown:Absorbency: So good I had to remind myself to change them more regularly. The first day I accidentally wore it all day! I also found them very comfortable, no wet feeling at all, even on a heavy day. I had NO LEAKS. Literally none the whole week except for the day I ran out of this style and had to revert to a different brand. BOTH of my other style leaked which just goes to show that the length and size of the Eco Lily's is great.Comfort: There's no denying that if you've never used washable fabric pads before you'll find these bulkier than the disposable kind (unless you bought the cheap homebrand type which feel like footballs). This will initially take some getting used to but it doesn't take long until you forget about it. I found the front of the Eco Lily pads stayed in place really well (hence no leaks) however sometimes it did get a bit bunched up at the back. I have the same problem with other brands I've had though so it might just be my big butt. That is literally my ONLY criticism of this product and cit ertainly wouldn't stop me buying more of them because that sometimes happens with disposable pads too.Cleanliness: I love the grey fabric which means you won't see discolouration of the fabric. My other styles, after a long time of using them, have discoloured now and are a bit unpleasant to look at. That shouldn't happen with the Eco Lily. I found them super easy to rinse after removal and then to handwash with soap later on. The water ran clear much more quickly with this style than my other style which I washed at the same time. I imagine that means it'll clean more effectively in the machine as well.Appearance: I like the purple pattern on the water resistant fabric. It would be nice if they had a range of styles though (like other brands do) because it is fun to have funky fabrics to choose from however let's be honest, it's going straight into our underwear so why does it matter? In summary, I highly recommend this product and will be buying more. Other versions I've seen online can be ridiculously expensive (I even had to pay import duty on some a couple of years ago!) so these are excellent value as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,2021-02-15 00:00:00,Eco Lily Reusable Sanitary Pads (6Pk for Heavy Flow),"This is the third different brand of cloth sanitary pads that I've bought and it's definitely my favourite.

"Firstly let me say I am thrilled that there are so many eco friendly alternatives to standard plastic filled sanitary products and I am here to praise that. So I was really looking forward to using these pads because of reading a lot of previous positive reviews and I was intrigued to see what I would make of them myself. My period usually lasts about 7 days; heavy for the first 3 then significantly reduces and I was genuinely surprised with just how much these pads absorbed! I think I used between 3 and 4 on my heavy days and then down to 2 and just needed 1 on both day 6 and 7. This made me very happy as I was worried about leaking which thankfully did not happen. The pads were easy to rinse under the cold water tap first before washing them through properly on a 30° or 40° cycle. I thought they would be really long, from looking at others pictures but they actually didn't seem that long in reality perhaps just slightly longer than a night pad. The overall look was nice, good quality, packaged nicely, the material was comfortable and soft, the popper was good quality and didn't come undone at any point either. Unfortunately I do have some negative points about the product which could just be my own personal experience but I wanted to give a completely honest review.1. I thought the pad needed an extra popper fastener, there is the option to have a looser or tighter fitting but whilst on the tightest fitting there is no other popper to use, to fasten the extra bit of wing, so it just sort of flaps about and can be annoying.2. I felt the pad wasn't as secure as others had mentioned, it was perhaps the silkly material on the back of the pad which made it more prone to slipping if I wasn't wearing tight trousers.3. I am sad to say that whilst the pads were a soft comfortable material against my skin, they were not comfortable overall whilst active. I went out for a walk wearing one of these and it was the most awful thing. It felt like I had a nappy on, I kept having to rearrange, I was very aware of it being there and it made it far less enjoyable. I will admit when I went for a walk again I swapped the pad for an tampon to avoid the nappy like sensation.I understand not everyone's views will be the same, this was my own personal experience and I do plan on continuing to use these as often as I can.

It just means that I will perhaps look into a cup or plastic free tampons for when I'm out and about.",firstly let i say i be thrilled that there be so many eco friendly alternative to standard plastic fill sanitary product and i be here to praise that so i be really look forward to use these pad because of read a lot of previous positive review and i be intrigue to see what i would make of they myself my period usually last about 7 day heavy for the first 3 then significantly reduce and i be genuinely surprised with just how much these pad absorb i think i use between 3 and 4 on my heavy day and then down to 2 and just need 1 on both day 6 and 7 this make i very happy as i be worried about leak which thankfully do not happen the pad be easy to rinse under the cold water tap first before wash they through properly on a 30 ° or 40 ° cycle i think they would be really long from look at other picture but they actually do not seem that long in reality perhaps just slightly long than a night pad the overall look be nice good quality package nicely the material be comfortable and soft the popper be good quality and do not come undo at any point either unfortunately i do have some negative point about the product which could just be my own personal experience but i want to give a completely honest review.1 i think the pad need an extra popper fastener there be the option to have a loose or tighter fitting but whilst on the tight fitting there be no other popper to use to fasten the extra bit of wing so it just sort of flap about and can be annoying.2 i feel the pad be not as secure as other have mention it be perhaps the silkly material on the back of the pad which make it more prone to slip if i be not wear tight trousers.3 i be sad to say that whilst the pad be a soft comfortable material against my skin they be not comfortable overall whilst active i go out for a walk wear one of these and it be the most awful thing it feel like i have a nappy on i keep have to rearrange i be very aware of it be there and it make it far less enjoyable i will admit when i go for a walk again i swap the pad for an tampon to avoid the nappy like sensation i understand not everyone 's view will be the same this be my own personal experience and i do plan on continue to use these as often as i can it just mean that i will perhaps look into a cup or plastic free tampon for when i be out and about,,,2021-03-19,0.9779378771781921,0.00012692809104919434,,-0.9942146241664886,-0.9990085661411285,0.9997575879096985,0.0011604130268096924,2,2,0,2,2,1,2
"I've been wanting to go plastic-free for a long time, but I've always been nervous because I've had heavy periods all my life. I love the idea of mooncups but I don't like tampons, so I've always known I'd need a non-invasive plastic-free alternative to the sanitary towels I've been using for years. Now that I have these, I'd never go back!Firstly, these towels are so, so comfortable. We get used to having to wear plastic in our pants, but now I have these I wonder how I ever put up with plastic for so long. My periods are so much more comfortable now, I don't have plastic sticking to my thighs or anywhere else, and these towels barely move at all either.There can be some movement, but it all depends on the kind of underwear you wear. I tend to wear my tighter-fitting underwear during my period now that I have these towels and they never move, and they've also never moved while I've been asleep either which is pretty amazing - I fall asleep on my front but I always wake up on my back, so there's plenty of opportunity for them to move around! I haven't had any leaks either, which amazes me considering I often leaked when I was using plastic sanitary towels and often ended up having to wear two at a time.These towels are easy enough to clean, too - I shove them in the washing machine at 30 degrees for around 20-30 minutes and then dry them overnight on my radiator and they're ready to be used again. I have noticed there can be some staining, but the towel is clean, so I think I might try soaking them in cold water before I wash them which the box recommends to avoid staining.I also think these would be wonderful for anyone who's just started their period - particularly younger people who start their period while they're in school. A zip-up bag comes in the box for your used towels until you can get home to wash them, and I think they'd be so much more discreet for any school-age person who's perhaps nervous about starting their period.

"My daughter is at the age her first period could start anytime. She carries a pack of sanitary towels in her school bag ""just in case""Thinking back to my own experience of my first period, it was actually quite traumatising. I flow heavily each time and can be in agonising pain with cramps as well as lower back pain. Other than a talk at school informing girls there was only 2 products on the market, pads or tampons. Little other information was given. So the amount of blood and the pain I was in, I literally thought something was seriously wrong and I was dying!Not wanting this for my daughter, I'm completely open with her and she is comfortable in asking me all kinds of questions.One of the biggest bugbear of mine, is how wet I feel with every pad and constantly needing to change. Self conscious about leakage was a particular worry when I was at school, scared all the boys could see and smell the blood.I hate pads with a passion and I've never felt tampons are appropriate for a young girl first starting out so I looked into seeing if there is anything new on the market.Of course you can buy period underwear, but most say to be worn in conjunction with pads/tampons. Which kind of defeats the purpose.My sister-in-law told me she uses a moon cup. But like tampons, not sure it's ideal for my daughter. But then I came across the reusable eco lily pads. I read reviews which were great but everyone is different right? Best way to really test them is using them myself.Omg! I wish these was available when I was a girl. I have felt so dry through out, they're so comfortable to wear and never moved. Best of all, far few changes needed. I could easily get through 3-4 packs of towels for a 5 day period. However, I have only used 2 towels a day! One in the morning that lasts through the day and a change before bed.So easy to clean, does not smell and no irritation as the material is so soft against your skin, unlike disposable pads that can cause nappy rash!I will be donating my daughters school bag pack to a Womens homeless shelter and I will be buying her eco lily instead for when she starts.

"I have been considering switching to reusable sanitary products for many months now, so I bought these on a whim when my preferred brand of disposables was unavailable. I have previously tried a few different cups with no avail, so cloth pads seemed like the way to go!I bought a box each of the regular and large/heavy flow size, which is more than enough to get me through my period. I'd say that the medium size is equivalent to most disposables, whereas the heavy flow pads are more the size of maternity towels.

I've experienced no leakage whatsoever, even on my heaviest days, and I've found that these pads feel much drier in between changes. They can hold a lot! For this reason I'm having to change less often, which eases the burden on washing them.Cleaning them is easy - just rinse with cold water, then wash on a 30° cycle without any conditioner. I usually leave mine in a tub of cold water until I have enough to wash together. They come out looking good as new, which I'm sure the dark grey colour helps with!I especially like that each pack includes a waterproof travel bag, with a separate space for your wet and dry pads, so it's easy to change on the go.Overall, I'm really pleased with these and I definitely won't be going back to disposables.

"I wanted to love these, but they just didn't hit the mark for me. Here's why:Cons:-Very thick, to the point you can see them through even a thick pair of jeans, so you're limited in what you can wear.-Very warm fabric, makes your hooha sweaty and doesn't let the area breathe, this results in you feeling really uncomfortable and hot down there.-The biggest con is the fact they aren't wide enough. There are 2 sets of adjustable buttons, and I was so shocked to see the 'loosest' button was still quite tight. You need to be wearing panties that have a very thin gusset so that the buttons can clip comfortably underneath without creating a bulge. I know most women tend to wear comfier loser panties when on their period due to pain and bloating, but it seems these pads were made to be put on top of a thong or something similar. I'd say this was the biggest con for me.-They slide back and forth and need to be 'adjusted' at times.-Really unpleasant charcoal type smell even after washing several times as the instructions state, the smell would make me sick, this is before even using them.-Blood clots remain sitting on top and aren't absorbed the way they are with traditional pads.-Washing these pads is very tedious and sort of gross. You can't place them directly in the washing machine without hand washing first, but doing that was a bit gnarly for me - period blood is not something a person enjoys touching or seeing running down my sink. Plus it was time consuming to wash, especially if you're a busy mother like me who also works full time and has a thousand other things going on, washing these pads before putting in the machine was an added chore.PROS-Great long length-Can hold an impressive amount of fluid.After using these for 3 cycles and really trying to enjoy the benefits of saving money on pads and not being exposed to harmful chemicals with traditional pads, I decided they weren't for me, so I actually threw them away a few days ago.

I'd say this was the biggest con for me.-They slide back and forth and need to be 'adjusted' at times.-Really unpleasant charcoal type smell even after washing several times as the instructions state, the smell would make me sick, this is before even using them.-Blood clots remain sitting on top and aren't absorbed the way they are with traditional pads.-Washing these pads is very tedious and sort of gross. You can't place them directly in the washing machine without hand washing first, but doing that was a bit gnarly for me - period blood is not something a person enjoys touching or seeing running down my sink. Plus it was time consuming to wash, especially if you're a busy mother like me who also works full time and has a thousand other things going on, washing these pads before putting in the machine was an added chore.PROS-Great long length-Can hold an impressive amount of fluid.After using these for 3 cycles and really trying to enjoy the benefits of saving money on pads and not being exposed to harmful chemicals with traditional pads, I decided they weren't for me, so I actually threw them away a few days ago. It's a shame because I genuinely really wanted to like these.Hope this review helps!",i want to love these but they just do not hit the mark for i here be why cons:-very thick to the point you can see they through even a thick pair of jean so you be limited in what you can wear.-very warm fabric make your hooha sweaty and do not let the area breathe this result in you feel really uncomfortable and hot down there.-the big con be the fact they be not wide enough there be 2 set of adjustable button and i be so shocked to see the loose button be still quite tight you need to be wear panty that have a very thin gusset so that the button can clip comfortably underneath without create a bulge i know most woman tend to wear comfy loser panty when on their period due to pain and bloating but it seem these pad be make to be put on top of a thong or something similar i would say this be the big con for me.-they slide back and forth and need to be adjust at times.-really unpleasant charcoal type smell even after wash several time as the instruction state the smell would make i sick this be before even use them.-blood clot remain sit on top and be not absorb the way they be with traditional pads.-washing these pad be very tedious and sort of gross you can not place they directly in the washing machine without hand washing first but do that be a bit gnarly for i period blood be not something a person enjoy touch or see run down my sink plus it be time consume to wash especially if you be a busy mother like i who also work full time and have a thousand other thing go on wash these pad before put in the machine be an add chore pros great long length can hold an impressive amount of fluid after use these for 3 cycle and really try to enjoy the benefit of save money on pad and not be expose to harmful chemical with traditional pad i decide they be not for i so i actually throw they away a few day ago it be a shame because i genuinely really want to like these hope this review help,,,2024-09-16,-0.7800701260566711,-0.9357631504535675,,-0.8856679439544678,-0.5610002279281616,,,2,2,0,5,1,0,0
"So I've actually been using these for two years now and finally got round to writing a review.In my two years of using these I can honestly say they look as good as new! Yes, they're a different way of thinking about periods and hygiene but there are so many benefits of using these.1) I have found these really absorbent and as someone who suffers with heavy periods, I have no longer had any flooding incidents.2) although a little bulky to wear, they're quite comfortable and not smelly at all.3) I like the fact I'm helping the environment! No more disposable used pads in landfill.4) they're surprisingly easy to clean. What I have found over the years is keeping a little bin (with a lid) that sits next to my loo, filled with cold water to store the used ones in. I give them a rinse before they go in the bin to get the excess blood out. But I actually don't bother if I'm out and about! If I'm about to shower, it sits in the bottom of the shower to rinse before going in my cold water bin!4) you get a handy water proof pouch to pop them in. When I get home, they go in my water filled bin.5) when I'm ready, they go in my washing machine and come out as good as new. They go in my tumble dryer too! Every month after they've been in the machine, I do run a cleaning cycle as I then know I'm keeping my machine clean!6) I've saved money!! Yes they're an initial outlay, but before long you've got your money back.No downsides really, and I'm glad I've switched to these.

"They're quite absorbant but I've only used one so far, as I'm a little nervous using it at night but will try and I will update the review in due course.They're quite comfy and not that thick when you compare to maternity pads which in my opionion are quite thick.Update February 2023So I've had a few cycles since buying (October 2022) and they are really great. I used to go through 2packs of the disposable liners (I would wear the night liners as I felt more protection from them. I would change my pad every four hours during the heaviest days my period.The reusable pads are great because the only thing I have to worry about is making sure I have a clean set for my next cycle but that's easy as I have a regular laundry routine and just throw them in with my clothes after I have hand-washed them.They may take some getting used to especially if you're coming from the thin disposable pads because they're quite thick, especially the heavy pads compared to the regular flow pads.During my heaviest flow days I now wear the regular flow pads when I'm out and about, I'm normally out for about 5 hours and I walk to all my destinations so it lasts all that time, however I used to wear the heavy flow ones initially when I went out and about because I thought that the extra protection was needed but it is not the case. If I was going to be doing a lot of sitting down I would wear the heavy pads as I tend bleed to the back and its just better protection for me.I've only had one bleedthrough and that was my own fault because I didn't change my pad before going to bed as I was exhausted but even then it was a small amount of spotting on my clothes instead of well the mess that usually occurs when you bleed through.Another big bonus is that I no longer get a rash, I used to always get a rash whenever I used disposable pads, it would be by the crease of my thigh and vulva, not sure why I would get a rash but ever since going reusable I've not had a rash, which is a big relief.I have purchased another pack to make it a total of 6 heavy flow pads and 6 regular flow pads as although I was managing with just 3 regular and 3 heavy flow I'd have to wash them as soon as I changed one otherwise I'd have one less for the next day if that makes sense, at least this way I can rinse them and put them in the wash bag until laundry day as I do laundry for the household twice a week. If you're curious about cloth pads I definitely recommend you buy the 3+3 heavy/regular combination so you have a nice mix.I wash mine on a 40degree wash because I do not have the patience to be messing around with buttons to adjust the temperature on a wash to 30degrees.I will eventually be buying 100% pure cotton pads from somebody that actually makes cloths pads but they're quite expensive and your period isn't going to wait until you have the funds to buy the nice cloth pads.As much as I wanted to stop using plastic (microfiber is a plastic) the fact that I've gone from single use plastic to reusable is a start and I think if you're curious about whether cloth pads are for you then this is a great way to find out as they're with you within a couple of days because amazon instead of whatever the 2-3week wait whilst your order is created and then another wait for it to be delivered.

I bought these because of heavy periods due to endometriosis. Even the super absorbent period pads don't work but these do. I pair with postpartum underwear and it is very good! These are unscented and breathable meaning they don't irritate the skin. I love how even with periods they don't have any odour like some other incontinence wear does when used in a period setting. They are also cheaper and a lot better. These are a staple for me now! I wish they done some with wings as I do wriggle when I sleep and they sometimes displace around that area at the crotch. But they are a lot wider and longer than period pads and definitely thicker!

"I've tried a couple of different brands of resusable pads before, and personally I find ecolily the best. The pads are very absorbent - I could go through the night without needing to change, with no overflow, and the pads don't feel heavy even when full. The fleece extends across the whole pads including the wings, which is great because unlike others, it means it doesn't stain across the sides. The fleece is comparatively thicker than on some other brands so these pads can seem a bit bulky at first, but I personally find that more secure because I know I don't need to worry about leaking. They're very comfortable and easy to clean, just rinse them in cold water then pop them in the wash without fabric softener, and tumble dry.The only downside I would say is that the carry bag it comes with isn't large enough to hold all 6 pads at the same time, so it wouldn't be practical if you couldn't use washing facilities every day. But if you're just at home/school/work, then they're definitely a brand worth checking out.",5.0 out of 5 stars,2022-01-11 00:00:00,Eco Lily Reusable Sanitary Pads (6Pk for Heavy Flow) -- Odour-Absorbing Charcoal Bamboo Pads for Women Sanitary Towels -- Reusable Pads Menstrual with Waterproof Wet Bag,"I've tried a couple of different brands of resusable pads before, and personally I find ecolily the best.

I bought them cause I didn't want the normal pads to irritate my skin, these one are soft and they feel good",they be comfy on the skin the 1st time i use they they be move too much on the panty and i get spot here some tip i would reccomend to use they with tight panty the one i be use that day be not so the pad be move the absorb a lot for sure even the small one easy to clean just wash in the sink with cold water till the water get clean and after in the washing machine no smell at all and when they be dirty you can fold they and keep they in you bag inside their little black bag that arrive together with the pad i could not fit they all in that bag tho but when you be not home for work or for the day you do not need to bring they all in general i feel satisfied of it and of my decision to not to use the normal pad anymore i buy they cause i do not want the normal pad to irritate my skin these one be soft and they feel good,,,2020-06-15,-0.9369813203811646,0.9997417330741882,,,0.9818228483200073,,,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"I've been trying to change to eco sanitary products for over a year. I tried the cup but didn't get on with it (or a few options actually). Then when the covid19 pandemic caused all the shops to run out of my usual sanitary pads I found these... I was sceptical at first, but wow these are a game changer. I'm so pleased I invested in these. They are so much more comfortable than regular pads (that used to give me a rash). I don't like tampons as I can't get on with them so pads are all I use. They're super absorbant. They feel great against my skin. They are a little thicker than a regular pad, but you get used to it. It's like having a soft plush pillow between your legs! Washing is easy, just bung them in the machine (unfolded) and run on a normal wash (no more than 40 degrees) but don't add fabric softener. Then they go in the tumble dryer on a synthetic (lower heat) cycle and they're done. They are brilliant. No waste and no rashes. I highly recommend these. They might get a bit warm in summer with them being thicker but it's a small price to pay to save my skin! If you were umming an ahhing about buying these, don't. Just get them.

"These are great, Ive used them for 2 months now and don't think I'd go back to normal pads. I could go like 8 hours without changing the pad on a heavy period and it doesn't leak through, it absorbs really well, it's hard to tell sometimes if its full as it doesn't have that wet, sitting in a puddle feeling like normal pads but if left on too long can get that period smell. They're pretty easy to clean. I usually just rinse it while i have a shower until the water runs clear and then squeeze a bit of soap on it and rinse it then stick it in with the washing and usually use an antibacterial liquid that will make sure everything is sanitised and wont hold on to smells. They are much more comfortable than a normal pad, it doesn't really move once in position but if it does its easy to adjust it. Not like normal pads where if you put it in the wrong place its hard to adjust it after and feels like wearing a nappy. This just feels like sitting on a cloud.

"So my first time using these I'm fed up of throwing money in the bin (i know there not much), ruining knickers where the normal pads super stick & rip them & I'm getting a bit more eco friendly.

So I liked the dark colour underneath which feels soft & silky like a swim suit material. The pad (extra long) is thicker than my usual pad but you dont notice it. They have 2 poppers to select the width of your panties which is good (big girl). The pad fabric is soft, like a thin sheepskin blanket. It comes with a 2 pocket bag so one fresh one used.

They have 2 poppers to select the width of your panties which is good (big girl). The pad fabric is soft, like a thin sheepskin blanket. It comes with a 2 pocket bag so one fresh one used. I have not had any smell until I decided to wipe the pad which then it did. I do feel fresh & forget I've got it on. They can slide a little but not enough for concern. I've cleaned them by rinsing in cold water until the water runs clear this is when you realise how much fluid the pad has held/soaked up. I put them on the air to dry.in final picture you can see they dry great back to normal.You can put in machine on cold wash, no detergent & dryer on low heat. On my first 2 days I went through 15 pads then 2 eco pads a day. I wish i knew about these a long time ago.",so my first time use these i be feed up of throw money in the bin i know there not much ruin knicker where the normal pad super stick rip they i be get a bit more eco friendly i be middle of period when start these to test from normal pad instruction easy except for the under side have the logo but do not state if back or front but i prefer back but i do not think there be a right or wrong so i like the dark colour underneath which feel soft silky like a swim suit material the pad extra long be thick than my usual pad but you do not notice it they have 2 popper to select the width of your panty which be good big girl the pad fabric be soft like a thin sheepskin blanket it come with a 2 pocket bag so one fresh one use i have not have any smell until i decide to wipe the pad which then it do i do feel fresh forget i have get it on they can slide a little but not enough for concern i have clean they by rinse in cold water until the water run clear this be when you realise how much fluid the pad have hold soak up i put they on the air to dry.in final picture you can see they dry great back to normal you can put in machine on cold wash no detergent dryer on low heat on my first 2 day i go through 15 pad then 2 eco pad a day i wish i know about these a long time ago,,,2019-12-28,-0.9881617426872253,0.004160851240158081,,-0.9728195865948995,-0.9997181296348572,,-0.9942810237407684,1,2,0,3,1,0,2

"Overall I really like these pads. I have heavy flow and the absorbency is amazing and had zero leaks. They are also very comfortable as the liquid gets wicked away from skin. However, they can slide around in my pants and I need to readjust them regularly, so I tend to use them at home rather than at work or when out and about. The heavy flow pads are fairly bulky but no worse than standard maxi pads really. Don't know how they will feel in warm weather as the fabric is thick and like fleece, so they may be a bit warm in a heat wave. Very easy to wash and found the waterproof bag very useful.

My usual fantastic/eco pads were unavailable so thought I'd get these to tide me over. I use lots of amazon brand stuff and am very happy with it. However I'd imagine these to be size/shape of an always medium/large incontinence pad. They arrived - HUGE!! The type you'd use for elderly people 😳!! Or I admit the type I needed about 6 months ago when i was practically in nappies due to menopausal incontinence... but now having gotten about 90% of my bladder control back and for the first time in about 3 years being able to safely wear jeans again these were not what I needed.

"Very comfortable to wear and no causes no irritation at all as this is not a fragranced product ~ thankfully. It manages to stay in place perfectly despite not having wings and is much more capable of holding pee than the usual brands are.Occasionally these do not manage to contain my full on accidents which then means either underwear change (underneath the pad gets damp if it is too much) or it is a full on trouser change. However, that would be impossible for any pad to manage to do but just wanted it to be known that if full on accidents are the main issue, then the other Amazon product which I also use would be a huge help. That is the Amazon ""adult pull up"" as I call them to my kids who also happen to be in pull ups to try to help them understand.These also work great if you happen to have heavy periods due to the nature of the product.These are excellent value for money and is significantly less than the so called leading brands. It is already very pricey having bladder issues so expensive pads on top is definitely not something that is needed!These would be ideal for people who happen to have leaks as I am unable to feel I need to go until seconds before I do and these can contain that if it isn't say, an early morning pee or a pee after drinking a lot of water, for example.The products arrive in a plain box which is impossible to tell what is inside.

The pad fits well, stays discreet under clothing, and doesn't smell even after long use.Value for money is great compared to well-know and expensive brands, and I've found the quality to be just as good (if not better). Highly recommend these pads to anyone looking for comfortable, dependable protection at a reasonable price!I was looking for huge and long pads for my incontince (accidents) when I coughed alot especially when I have flu.

"4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. These are decent quality pads, which I used to supplement my usual brand (Tena). The pads are described as maximum absorption, and they do cope well with moderate amounts.They are slightly shorter than Tena pads, but the adhesive strip is longer. Not suitable for overnight use, unless used as a liner for a large non-adhesive shaped pad, which is how I use them.These pads are quite bulky - definitely not the same as an ultra-thin pad. Reasonable value. One plus point, each pad is individually wrapped in a thin plastic pouch. These wrappers are useful for disposing of used pads discreetly.",5.0 out of 5 stars,2024-10-09 00:00:00,"by Amazon Incontinence Pads Extra Plus, 48 Pads (6 Packs of 8), Individually wrapped, Unscented (Previously Amazon Basic Care) - Packaging May Vary","4.5 stars, rounded up to 5.

"Got these for my elderly Gran who is on diuretics so needs pads. She previously bought hers from Asda but they didn't have any in stock so thought we'd try these out.She rates them much higher than the Asda ones, and also the main brands. She said they're by far the best pads she has tried - they absorb a lot, she said they're longer than the others and they don't fall off. She is only using 1 of these a day while she had to use 2 of the other brands per day.Also ideal for someone housebound like her as we can order them direct to her quickly and without worry of them being out of stock.Really pleased that we tried these, it's the small things that can make her life a little bit better, and these have clearly exceeded her expectations!",5.0 out of 5 stars,2025-08-29 00:00:00,"by Amazon Incontinence Pads Extra Plus, 48 Pads (6 Packs of 8), Individually wrapped, Unscented (Previously Amazon Basic Care) - Packaging May Vary","Got these for my elderly Gran who is on diuretics so needs pads.
