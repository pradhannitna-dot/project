"Works for absorption, but not very comfortable to wear. Thick so it doesn't compress to form to your shape. Feels like a large lump, which will absorb less due it being folded.

"These are the best overnight and extra heavy flow pads by far. In a perfect world, I could get by using only period panties, but the first 2-3 days are way too heavy for period panties available on the market (I haven't tried the disposable ones yet). I also tend to leak on the front instead of the back, which 99% of pads and period panties are made for. Due to their length, these work well, especially if you wear them backwards. Because of their size and thickness, they aren't the most comfortable if you're being active.","These are the best overnight and extra heavy flow pads by far.

"I needed a pad for a temporary bladder leakage and since the old type pads that were used with a sanitary belt (yep, I'm that old) haven't been made in decades and would be the ideal resolution, I went looking for something that would suffice for small bladder leakage problems. Since I used to use Always products years ago, and after researching several pad options, I thought this would be a great way to protect my clothing should an instance occur. Well, when I opened the package and opened one of the pads I was really surprised. These pads are huge in length, but are good in width. except that I have to cut off the bottom 2 inches of the pad at the fold when you open it unless you want to use it for night time urine protection. I bought these for the thickness and for the ""wings"" but the only problem is that there is virtually little to no adhesion! I have to use a small safety pin in the front to attach the pad to my underware. Kind of defeats the purpose. For now, they will suffice. Should I need to order this type of pad again, I would not buy these Always and would look for something else. It's a shame because if it were not for the lack of adhesion and the length, these would be perfect.","I needed a pad for a temporary bladder leakage and since the old type pads that were used with a sanitary belt (yep, I'm that old) haven't been made in decades and would be the ideal resolution, I went looking for something that would suffice for small bladder leakage problems.

"These pads are so comfortable and I love them but the package I received this time has very poor adhesive, so they fall off my underwear every time I pull them up after using the bathroom. Also this package, after wearing the pad for about 2 hours I went to the bathroom and when I pulled my pants down there was cotton all over the place and a hole in the back of the pad. The same thing happened with my size 3 pads so I'm not sure if the quality went down or this is a coincidence that two different size pads of the same brand have the same problems. Other brands like from Amazon and Walmart have much better adhesive and do not tear but are not quite as comfortable, they are less thick and soft.","These pads are so comfortable and I love them but the package I received this time has very poor adhesive, so they fall off my underwear every time I pull them up after using the bathroom.

I recently relocated to the UK from Canada. I used to buy these all the time in Canada as you can find them in Canadian stores and they are inexpensive. Why the hell can't you find these in UK stores? I thought brexit was bad but this is just nonsense. I have endometriosis and large uterine fibroids and as a result have heavy periods . I wear these at night or on long car rides/ flight as it's the only thing that protects my clothes and bedding unlike the crepe thin crap pads sold in U.K markets. Had I'd known that I would not find these pads here then I would have bought a suitcase of these across the border. And for the low reviews and people complaining about that it's not good for incontinence issues - Jesus - buy the appropriate pads for that.

"I hate that I have to write a negative review for a product I've used and never used to have issues with for years, I've been using this brand since I first got my period over 10 years ago and I never used to have a problem but ever since they updated the design/formula I've been having more leakage and problems ever since. It feels like a cheap copy of the product I used to love.As someone who has always experienced period anxiety the change in these pads makes it so much worse, I feel like I'm going through pads more often because I don't feel the secureness I used to. So much for the leak guard I've leaked or almost leaked through more of these new pads than I've ever done in my entire life & especially at night!, I don't know what exactly is going on with the wings but I feel like that is half the problem and leakage from the side is more than likely to happen. Along with this god awful new design at the bottom and top of the pads where the pad itself (the absorbant part) is no longer rounded ???? Who thought that was a good idea?!?! This also restricts people on the way that they can wear them I know many people including myself that have worn them backwards/upside down/the wrong way up in the past for whatever reason because why would I want what should be the bottom end at the top because there's a like split in it ???? and the other end is pointed like WHY??? It feels like there's less of a pad because of it!I also have had issues with the stickiness of the pads themselves, the wings hardly stick at all and the pad itself is either too sticky or not sticky enough. Literally what is going on ??? The fact I've been using this new formula for months and it's gotten to the point I've had to write a review really says everything.I swear every time I buy a new packet the amount I get is less and less (started with 32 then 24 and now 22!!), I know this is captalism but like with the quality change and the fact I feel like I'm going through more pads because of it because I don't feel safe to last as long as I usually word because the leak guard isn't as good it's a joke. My period isn't getting shorter or lighter by you putting less pads in a packet. Bring back the 32 pack that was great amount for me personally, 22 isn't enough! I know it shouldn't matter given the fact I'm getting 4 boxes of 22 pads but I used to be able to go through only 1 packet of 32 per period now because of the quality change & drop in pads I'm going through almost 1 and 1/2 to almost instead. At the same price!Literally the only reason my rating isn't lower is because I do still use them and I do have somewhat a decent experience despite all this, being able to buy a multipack of 4 is a great thing and I feel like saves money in the long run, and I still do find them comfortable (for a pad) given my sensory issues. It's just a shame that they decided to change something (or a lot of things really) that didn't really need fixing. & I've heard it's not just the ultra pads that have these issues it's most if not all the other versions of always pads.","I hate that I have to write a negative review for a product I've used and never used to have issues with for years, I've been using this brand since I first got my period over 10 years ago and I never used to have a problem but ever since they updated the design/formula I've been having more leakage and problems ever since.

"Tried these a couple of cycles ago for the first time & won't be going back to my previous big brand products. These are soft, comfortable, no soreness/rubbing or any kind of irritation, all things I'd sadly accepted as unavoidable until finding these. They make no rustling noises & you can barely feel you're wearing a pad. Yes they need changing a little more frequently but I find they absorb so much better than any other brand I've ever tried. No leaks so far even on heavy flow days. So pleased to see this product in my local supermarkets too. I've tried the day & night ones & definitely find these night ones a better size, day ones for me personally are suitable only for really light flow days. Absolutely no regrets in giving this product a try","Tried these a couple of cycles ago for the first time & won't be going back to my previous big brand products.

"I'm so amazed at these pads, I was hesitant when opening the box as the pads are super thin so wasn't expecting much, however was very pleasantly surprised! They are so absorbent and I had no leaks despite me worrying about the thickness. This is also one of the first pads that actually sticks properly and stays put which is usually an issue - its not fun having a sticky wing sticking to sensitive parts! They're also so soft against the skin, its feels so comfortable and doesn't make the dreaded rustling nappy noise when you walk! As its super thin, you can barely even feel it, with different brands you're always aware of the chunky pad, this one is magic! Don't hesitate to give these a go, like me im sure you'll be very pleasantly surprised! I will be purchasing these from now on, no more leaks or discomfort!","I'm so amazed at these pads, I was hesitant when opening the box as the pads are super thin so wasn't expecting much, however was very pleasantly surprised!

"The Real-World ContextFor those of us with exceptionally heavy cycles or who work demanding shift patterns, disposable products are a necessity. On my heaviest days, I frequently ""double up"" on solutions to stay secure. As a UK customer, my main go-to is usually Daye, but Flo has become a vital part of my routine because of its accessibility. While mail-order brands can take days, I can get Flo next-day on Amazon Prime. This was a lifesaver during the recent 2025 festive period when I forgot my mail order and was too unwell with the flu to leave the house. It's also reassuring to know they are widely available locally at Boots, Superdrug, or Tesco in a pinch.Reduced Sensitivity & PerformanceSkin Comfort: Since switching to these, I have noticed significantly reduced sensitivity and irritation. I believe the naturally absorbent qualities of bamboo viscose are the key; they draw blood away from the skin in under a minute without the use of harsh chemicals.The ""Shift Worker"" Test: If you are on an 8--12 hour shift, the breathability of the Oeko-Tex organic bamboo is a game-changer. It prevents that ""damp"" or ""sweaty"" feeling common with plastic-based pads.Exercise & Odour: The bamboo provides natural odour control that actually works during workouts, all without the chemicals that can trigger my skin sensitivity.Thin & Discreet: These are slim enough to stay hidden under tight leggings while still handling a heavy flow as effectively as an Always Night pad.Privacy: A small but important detail - the plant-starch wrappers are very quiet to open, which is great for privacy in shared or workplace bathrooms.The Critical Bit (Fit & Adhesive)The ""Double Wings"" are a good concept, but the adhesive isn't quite as aggressive as mainstream plastic brands. I've found these stick very well to the inside of period pants, but they can struggle with ""silky"" synthetic underwear. If you're active or working a long shift, I highly recommend pairing them with cotton or bamboo-based briefs to ensure they stay centred.Sustainability & Ethics (Without the Guilt)Living in Scotland, I often feel a lot of ""eco-guilt"" due to government messaging regarding disposable period products. Buying from a female-founded, BCorp Certified brand helps ease that.Eco-Specs: They are 87% plant-based and PETA-certified vegan.Disposal: The wrappers are home-compostable, and while the pads go in general waste, they are biodegradable in landfill conditions.Bottom LineA high-performance, skin-friendly bridge for those who need the reliability of a disposable but want to support an ethical business.

"This is my fourth time purchasing Rael Organic Cotton Cover Sanitary Towels, and I keep coming back for a reason. I buy these for my wife, and she has consistently told me that they are noticeably more comfortable than other brands she has tried.The organic cotton cover feels soft and gentle on the skin, with no irritation at all. The pads are ultra thin but still offer reliable absorbency, so they feel light and breathable while providing enough protection for everyday use. She also really appreciates that they are unscented and hypoallergenic, which makes a big difference for sensitive skin.Overall, the comfort, quality, and peace of mind make these pads well worth it for us. We're very satisfied and will definitely continue purchasing. Highly recommended --- five stars without hesitation.","This is my fourth time purchasing Rael Organic Cotton Cover Sanitary Towels, and I keep coming back for a reason.

"Quite an expensive product, but you get what you pay for in this instance and worth every penny!

Hmmm since I started using these I found my period cramps are much better I'm not finding any sensitivity and no soreness like regular pads. The only thing is you can leak I wish they were thicker or better at holding because I've had quite a few accidents one being on my brand new sofa which has never happened to me ever before with normal pads. However normal pads do give me itching and soreness and also I get more cramps. So yes these are preferred as a fan of organic but need to be thicker not so thin,Hmmm since I started using these I found my period cramps are much better I'm not finding any sensitivity and no soreness like regular pads.

"I love the Mooncup brand and regularly use their cups, but sometimes I prefer wearing a pad, so I was eager to try these. Unfortunately, they weren't the right fit for me.The main issue was comfort, I found the pads a little too stiff and not as flexible as I like. I was very conscious of the fact I was wearing one, which I don't like. I kept checking mirrors to make sure it wasn't visible! The wings were also a downside. While fairly adhesive, they were small and didn't stay in place as well as I'd hoped.That said, the absorbency was great, and I experienced no leakage, so they do work well in that regard.

"Used for a second month now. No problems at all. On my heaviest day I've worn a tampon for part of the day but to be honest that was 'just in case', I think next month I won't bother. I've got 2 packs of the largest size, a pack of medium and one pack of light. Plenty to get through the 5/6 days for me 😊.I rinse them until the water pretty much runs clear and they then either go straight in a wash or in a wet bag until I put a wash on. Yes you have to rinse and squeeze out blood which on heavy days isn't the most pleasant job but it really doesn't take long. So worth it for the comfort and massive reduction in plastic waste!They definitely absorb more than even the biggest disposable pad.

No problems at all. On my heaviest day I've worn a tampon for part of the day but to be honest that was 'just in case', I think next month I won't bother. I've got 2 packs of the largest size, a pack of medium and one pack of light. Plenty to get through the 5/6 days for me 😊.I rinse them until the water pretty much runs clear and they then either go straight in a wash or in a wet bag until I put a wash on.

"Purchased these sanitary pads as was looking for something comfortable and to stop buying disposable pads. The pretty dark design is nice and discreet and they fit into panties well and secure easily in place with the popper. Like the little bag to store them in until they are ready to be washed, as keeps odours and mess at bay. The pads are easy to clean, just rinse and then put them in the washing machine. These pads are fine for light to medium days, but found they are not great for heavy flow as advertised, as they are a bit short in length and not wide enough which causes pad to leak slightly. Also for particularly heavy flow they could definitely benefit from being longer in length and wider at the back to save any leakages. Will look to buy some more reusable pads which are longer and wider for those heavier days and nights. Overall happy with purchase. Nice pads of good value and quality.","Purchased these sanitary pads as was looking for something comfortable and to stop buying disposable pads.

"Ladies, please go for this. Not only has it completely reduced my use of tampos and pads, of which are very bad for the environment, I no longer get the skin rashes that normally come with the pads that most often aren't talked about.It does to be fair feel like a cinder block in your pants at first (though this does not mean they are uncomfortable by any mean, they are just noticeably thicker and bigger than pads) because it is very thick but it gets the job done and there are medium strength ones anyways so to each their own. Rest assured when you sleep, no matter what position you pull, blood will not escape this beast. 100% very good purchase, will be buying more.My recommendation if you get heavy flow regularly on periods, go for the heavy flow one as it really can capture all of your waste. I also wear it outside of period to catch discharge because it's just that comfortable to wear and protects my sensitive skin from non-cotton underwear at times and chafing.","Ladies, please go for this.

"This pack of 6 lasted me from the afternoon of day 1 to the evening of day 2, which is about the same as disposables for me. The fleecy upper material is soft and very comfortable, and I didn't find them bulky at all. Absorbency seems good, but perhaps not as quick to wick away wetness. I did notice a slight smell, I suspect the chemicals in disposable pads usually control this. No problems with leaking or moving.I used these 6 pads, then switched back to disposables whilst I set about washing them. I put them in a plastic bathroom bin and rinsed with cold water. I'm not squeamish but I did find this a little unpleasant. Then in the washing machine on 40 degrees for an hour, with normal detergent. They air dry quickly. I put them in with the bath mat, I didn't fancy mixing with clothes.On the whole a positive experience. I will give another cycle's trial before I purchase another set of 6. Main negatives for me are the rinsing (I may try skipping this step), smell (natural but slightly unpleasant) and not being able to monitor how much I'm bleeding (difficult to see or tell).","This pack of 6 lasted me from the afternoon of day 1 to the evening of day 2, which is about the same as disposables for me.

"I was a bit hesitant making the move from disposables to reusables, but based on previous reviews I decided to give Eco Lily a go. I purchased one pack in my first order (3x large & 3x medium), which were so good that I immediately ordered another 6x medium & 6x light pads. The large and medium are very good, super absorbent and very comfortable. They fit and stay in place perfectly and hold a lot more than disposable pads. I am a lot more confident wearing these cloth pads that haven't leaked once, (compared to disposables that would leak on occasion and you'd often feel like you to need pop to the bathroom to 'go and check'). The first time I wore one I thought it felt a bit bulkier than a disposable, but I very soon got used to it and decided that I preferred this extra feeling of comfort and confidence that I was well covered anyway.That said, the small/light pads are not as good. They are still very absorbent, but they do not stay in place as well as the medium/large. Probably because they are smaller and have less 'bulk/length' behind them to stop them sliding up/down your underwear with just the popper behind it. I did have to keep pulling it up every time I went to the bathroom. I have decided to use the large/medium most of the time and only use the light for the last very light day as just a back-up. But honestly, if you are considering reusable cloth pads then Eco Lily large/medium is a great option.","I was a bit hesitant making the move from disposables to reusables, but based on previous reviews I decided to give Eco Lily a go.

"I got a package of 3 large, and 3 medium and honesty I did not take out a ruler to visualize the size before purchase... but I was a bit shocked about the large-sized ones. They are ENOURMOUS and I don't consider them fit to wear during the day with normal trousers. I use them at night now. In terms of absorbency, I was really positively surprised. The surface looks and feels like a soft fleece sweater (is therefore very comfortable on the skin and feels MUCH nicer than common throw-away large pads surface) which I did not expect to take in liquid so well. I was sceptical at first but felt absolutely safe the second time wearing them. I rinsed them cold and washed them at 30 degrees then and they come out as new.","I got a package of 3 large, and 3 medium and honesty I did not take out a ruler to visualize the size before purchase... but I was a bit shocked about the large-sized ones.

"I just had to write a review about these sanitary pads, they are truly life changing. I didn't expect them to be as good as they are and so felt it necessary to write an in depth review.These arrived well packaged and I ordered 6 of the heavy flow pads as I tend to have two or three very heavy days.I was very impressed at how these pads kept me dry and comfortable during very heavy days. I used to use the disposable pads which had an annoying floral smell which impregnated my underwear. I hated it. These pads have no odour at all, even when saturated. They are soft and warm, but on a hot day, do not make you feel sweaty or uncomfortable.The pads are fleecy, and very easy to clean. I just ran under cold water immediately after removing it, and then once the water runs clear, I switched to warm water, used a little castille soap and washed the whole pad by hand. Then I wrung it out and left to air on an airer.I'm not squeamish about blood, so you may want to put in the washing machine, but they are so easy to clean by hand.They seem well made, the stitching is very nice and the material is good quality.Overall, I'm really happy to have found these. I'm putting less plastic into the environment and spending less overall too. Win win!","I just had to write a review about these sanitary pads, they are truly life changing.

"I have been thinking of trying a reusable pad for some time but was totally clueless which brand to try. I can across these whilst isolating having got covid. My time of the month happened earlier than expected and I kept forgetting to add some sanitary towels to my supermarket delivery. I ordered these on Amazon as they had next day delivery and I was about to run out. When they arrived, I was a bit anxious about a reusable pad but then thought it is no different to a Terry type nappy we wore as babies so would be fine. I gave it a try thinking I was not leaving home for a while so could quickly shower if there was a problem with leakage. However, I was extremely surprised how absorbent the pad was. It also felt soft, warm and fluffy rather than the horrible cold plastic which often makes you feel sore. The pads are easy to clean and I will probably invest in some more next month so I have 2 sets to use. I wish I had found this product years ago. Looking forward to saving money in the future and helping to save the planet.","I have been thinking of trying a reusable pad for some time but was totally clueless which brand to try.

"So if you're like me, and disposible sanitary pads irritate your body, make you feel uncomfortable, and make you feel a wee bit gross when wearing them, 100% give these a shot!I've just finished my first cycle using them and I'm never going back to disposable pads. These are comfortable, they stay in place. Super soft and fleecy material, that seems to absorb everything. I got longer between changing pads with these which was ideal for my 8 hour shift. Theres no odor at all. Zero leakage even over night, and I mean nothing! I have very heavy periods so this is a big plus. I didn't feel like I was sweating in them and they didn't crunch up like disposable ones do. They just stayed nice and flat and kept shape.I washed them all as instructed without Fabric conditioner, and they washed well.","So if you're like me, and disposible sanitary pads irritate your body, make you feel uncomfortable, and make you feel a wee bit gross when wearing them, 100% give these a shot!I've just finished my first cycle using them and I'm never going back to disposable pads.

"These are amazing! I wish I'd have bought them sooner. They are so comfortable and beat all my expectations. I didn't think they would be as good as the reviews and adverts were saying but they honestly are. They are super absorbent, you can't tell how full they are while wearing until you rinse them out, so very comfortable. I have really heavy periods but they didn't let me down once. If anything they are so much better than the disposable pads. They are really soft, I used to have a reaction to the disposable ones but these are so gentle. They are easy to use, 2 sets of poppers depending on how tight you need them for different underwear. If you wear big tight underwear they stay in place, you obviously have to wear appropriate underwear for them to stay put. They rinse out really easily and fold up with the poppers to go in the little storage bag until you are ready to wash them properly. They look quite thick as they are soft fleece but once you have got them on you really can't tell. I really wish I'd have tried them out sooner, I wouldn't ever go back to disposable ones again, they are so much better for the environment but for me they are also so much more comfortable, non irritant and I don't need 4 packets for 1 period.","These are amazing!

"Firstly I just want to say I was absolutely appalled at the Prospect of using anything reusable due to having THE WORST periods every month due to adenymyosis and endometriosis. My periods are super heavy.With old pads I would use one every 2 hours. One of these can last me overnight!!!! which is a GOD SEND as previously I would have fo set my alarms to get up and change otherwise it would be a massacre in the morning. ;( Be prepared for them to feel a bit thicker and when you pull your knickers back up after a wee etc make sure you have it sitting right as they aren't sticky they are secured with a popper, but you will learn to remember to do this and it's no hassle at all because you aren't running the toilet every hour or so. They are very easy to clean and look brand new each time they have come out of the wash. Without a doubt the best purchase I've made to date. And that's saying something.

"I've been trying to make eco-friendlier choices in all aspects of my life and had in the past used organic cotton sanitary pads. But I decided to try the reusable washable pads, even if it was just for the evenings and the heavier days at home.I've been using these and they're great. Unlike normal san-pro - you don't feel any liquid in fact the material draws the blood away from the surface and you feel dry. I've used two towels in a day, much less than I'd use with the ordinary towels.The only minus is that as other reviewers have said, it feels like they need an extra popper underneath and it can feel a bit bulky, but not seriously uncomfortable - perhaps undies which are a bit tighter would be better when wearing these. I don't think I'll be wearing them under my leggings at the gym, but for everyday use, under jeans etc, I wouldn't have a problem.As regards cleaning, it's pretty easy, just rinse them out and wash them without fabric softener. If you've had babies in reusable nappies, you could always soak them in a solution of napisan in a bucket like with the nappies, if you were really worried. They dry pretty quickly on the line, too!All round I'm happy to use these!","I've been trying to make eco-friendlier choices in all aspects of my life and had in the past used organic cotton sanitary pads.

"I wish I bought them much earlier - now used for 3 months.During pandemic/home office I thought it was a good time to try them and I was right.They are super absorbent, stay well in the panty. I worried that the side material is the same as the top, but there is no leakage. Rather thick, but eventually I don't really notice when using.I bought the package with mixed sizes - quite difficult to find the right size, would have been nicer to have a different pattern for different sizes. (or I should get another holder to separate them...)6 pieces may be enough, when using 5 daytime, soak during daytime and wash them in the evening and let them dry by morning. It was enough even during heavy flow, however I would recommend to buy more, you never know...I think the concept of 6 piece is weird - too much to try, too few to use during period without the fear you much wash every night. (finally when I bought more, I washed them every 1,5 days anyways... doesn't sound much different, but it gives you more freedom...)I have bought other manufacturer's cheaper products as well. Those are much thinner, with very same concept.It is true though that Eco Lily has better quality in the top material, also snaps are much easier to handle compare to the other product.

Those are much thinner, with very same concept.It is true though that Eco Lily has better quality in the top material, also snaps are much easier to handle compare to the other product. However, overall competitor cheaper product is also doing its job. So if price is a large factor, when choosing, you can reconsider...",5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0,2020-11-21 00:00:00,2020-11-21,Eco Lily Reusable Sanitary Pads (6Pk for 3 Medium + 3 Heavy),Eco
"Im new to the reuseable sanitary market and having used these for two cycles now I can completely say without hesitation that I'm a convert.My first 3 days are always very heavy and I must admit on my first cycle I decided to double up with a tampon during a trip to the cinema (I usually soak through a tampon within 2hrs during day 2) as I was fearful of making a terrible mistake and having to deal with leaks on seats and bloody crack marks on my jeans etc. However the rest of my cycles have been a breeze. If anything there is something odly comforting about the fleecy-ness. The same kind of feeling you get in the winter when you step out the bath and throw on a fleece onesie/ dressing gown, only this blanket is for cooch.I bought 2 lingerie wash bag, placed one in my wardrobe with my clean pads and some spare period pants for storage and the other sat inside my laundry bin so that when I throw them in the washing machine their in there together and it's less hassle!I would HIGHLY recommend making the switch ladies. Just try it. Let's normalise periods and encourage sustainability in doing so!!","Im new to the reuseable sanitary market and having used these for two cycles now I can completely say without hesitation that I'm a convert.My first 3 days are always very heavy and I must admit on my first cycle I decided to double up with a tampon during a trip to the cinema (I usually soak through a tampon within 2hrs during day 2) as I was fearful of making a terrible mistake and having to deal with leaks on seats and bloody crack marks on my jeans etc. However the rest of my cycles have been a breeze.

"Was not sure whether to purchase these but wanted to reduce the wastage from using disposable pads every month. I am so glad I bought these pads , took a while to get used to . I would suggest some snug fitting stretchy pants as they do move around abit. I like wearing loose fitting underwear but found the pads slid from back to front abit so went out to get some 'snuggier' pants and that solved the problem. The panty liner types are very absorbent . I also bought the medium and large pads for the monthlies and found them to be extremely absorbent, more so than disposable pads . No leakage at all. The sizes would be the same as disposable panty liners/ menstrual pads . I found that I don't need to change them as often as I would if I were using disposable ones. They are easy to clean , I usually give them a rinse when I'm in the shower and throw them into a bucket ready to go into the washing machine. They dry very quickly as well ready for the next use. Have bought a box of six panty liners and a box of three medium and three large pads and found them enough usage for both my daughter and I at this moment . If not I would not hesitate to buy some more. She is absolutely loving them as well , especially the fact that they are saving the planet . In the long run it saves on money and reducing the waste going into landfill sites. If you are unsure I wouldn't hesitate , just buy some and save your purse and the planet ! Also very fast delivery from the seller.","Was not sure whether to purchase these but wanted to reduce the wastage from using disposable pads every month.

"Switched to eco pads to try to save money and the planet. I like the waterproof bag for carrying clean/used pads during the day. They are thicker than disposable pads, and do cause more sweating because fabric is thicker. However, is waterproof with minimal slippage. Unfortunately, there is slippage and after some time, smell begins to stick to the fabric, even with rinsing the used one on changing (as per instructions), and washing same day, with two laundry tablets. Had to recently get some disposable back up as still washing these and unfortunately feel I will likely go back as they are more comfortable, don't hold any odd odours, and no slippage at all (with wings).I liked the concept, and they have saved some money over time but the design is not quite there.","Switched to eco pads to try to save money and the planet.

"This is my second set of reusable pads so I knew what to expect, still having a few of the old ones the difference was easy to see immediately. These one are more padded so much softer without being overly thick and they have varying lengths and thickness so it's good for different period days, they're super easy to clean I wash them when I'm in the shower and just hang them to dry and if I'm out the little baggie they come in has two zippers so it's easy to separate the clean ones from the used ones and I put some zip locks in the bag so I can put the used ones in a zip lock first then put them in the second compartment and wash them when I get home. Love everything about them, on day 3 onwards I only have to change once (using only two pads, one during the day one at nights) with no fear of leaking as they absorb quite a bit. On the heavier days I would use the thicker ones of course and could last around 4hrs before I have to change","This is my second set of reusable pads so I knew what to expect, still having a few of the old ones the difference was easy to see immediately.

"I have really appreciated these as a much better solution to feminine hygiene than conventional disposables. They don't stick painfully to you, don't need endlessly reordering, and are effective and generally really easy to handle.They wear well. I brought some almost three years ago and am only just starting to think about getting a new set. I did have to sew up a loose seam on one shortly after purchase but I have had no other issues with them needing repair or wearing out.The only problem I've had is that they do slide backwards and forwards in looser fitting underwear. On the whole, however, I would have said I have had less leaking with these than using disposables: they scrunch up less and have good absorbancy.To launder them, I generally put them through a low temperature delicates' wash without any sort of soap or other product (not because they are delicate, but for the clean cold water soak), and then I wash them again at 40C with my cottons (and my ordinary washing detergent). They have been quite happy with this treatment and look totally unused - no staining or unsavoury smell or anything - when it is finished.Given that they are durable and don't need a lot of elaborate or high temperature cleaning, they are almost certainly more ecological than disposables in the vast majority of circumstances. Which in this case, is just the cherry on the cake!","I have really appreciated these as a much better solution to feminine hygiene than conventional disposables.

"I have had these in my basket for so long, and just kept putting off buying them because I've never used reusable sanitary products before, but I have issues with lots of main stream products and finally got fed up and made an order.Initially the price seemed steep compared to a pack of towels, but obviously they're the only ones you'll need now for (I don't know how long? ) a good while I think, if not forever? So I got over that and just went for it.They have been nothing short of life changing. No crinkly noises when you're walking, no bunching up and causing unwanted problems, so so comfortable to wear, no smell, no leaking, list goes on.My only con if I had to have one, is obviously you have to physically wash them which can take a bit of getting used to, but that's definitely not a negative to the product. I have been rinsing mine through in cold water in the bathroom sink until the water is clear ish, and then putting them into a laundry bag and washing on 30 and have had no issues at all, they come out perfectly clean, no stains and no smell.Honestly if you're unsure like I was, definitely go for it, they're amazing.","I have had these in my basket for so long, and just kept putting off buying them because I've never used reusable sanitary products before, but I have issues with lots of main stream products and finally got fed up and made an order.Initially the price seemed steep compared to a pack of towels, but obviously they're the only ones you'll need now for (I don't know how long? ) a good while I think, if not forever?

"Many years of adding to landfill via monthly cycle, I decided to try these.Heavy menstrual bleeding is in the eye of the beholder to be honest, but I'm hurtling towards ""that"" age where they get sh**ter than they ever were. These can cope-ish on a rough day, but tbh that would be asking a lot of any product. I think they could be more secure- it would be greatly appreciated if there was a little product development in the way they secure to underwear. No one wants STs spinning around in their pants when they go to the toilet, they have to stay the right way up and in place otherwise, dignity lost.Took me a day to get used to carrying the dirty ones in the very discreet waterproof bag. They washed clean on low temps and worked exactly the same after.Pros- less waste, better for the Earth, non-perfumed and soft, they will cope with average/normal menstrual bleeding I'm sure. Menorrhagia on a bad day? Not so convinced. They wash well, the bag is waterproof. There is no scent, there's no smell when in use either.Cons- it takes a while to get used to the change, it takes a while to build faith, they're thick, they are secured in the middle with one press stud- it needs more (I'm not sure how you'd achieve that though, but that's why I don't work in product development).Give them a go.","Many years of adding to landfill via monthly cycle, I decided to try these.Heavy menstrual bleeding is in the eye of the beholder to be honest, but I'm hurtling towards ""that"" age where they get sh**ter than they ever were.

"It took a bit of courage to swap on to these, they aren't cheap for what they are but they are worth it. I had a few concerns buying these;Would they stay in the right position without sticky wings? Yes they do, and are more comfortable as a result, they naturally rest in the right place, no more leaks from placing it 2cm too far forward or back.Would the bulk of the fabric feel weird? They are a bit bigger than single use towels, however that is forgotten in seconds, because they are not as ridged as single use ones, they form around your body so it's not restrictive in the same way as using bigger single use products.Would they be as absorbent? I did a lot of research these came the top of a few lists for best absorbency, I'm not disappointed.Would the pack size be enough? For me, the smaller ones cover the day, and the larger for night, on a cold radiator with hand washing they are drying in a day and I use max 3 per day.Would they be prone to leaks? Not so far, actually because there fabric moulds around my body, I have had less leaks.Some report say they smell more than single use towels? If you use a scented towel, then yes you might notice a difference, I react to scented products so only ever use plain, i would say they are better than unscented single use.Would they feel a bit clammy or soggy, or heavy without the tech of lightweight single use towels? Nope, they are fine, I haven't felt like I was wearing a nappy at all!Are they any good for sensitive skin? I have swapped from a sensitive single use brand which I still reacted to towards the end of my cycle, this has not been so with these.","It took a bit of courage to swap on to these, they aren't cheap for what they are but they are worth it.

"Why has it taken me until I'm 46 to discover these?! I only have a few years left before my periods come to a natural end - all those years of horrible environment destroying disposable pads and tampons - I'm both ashamed of myself for not using these sooner but also frustrated that these aren't being sold in mainstream stores and advertised on tv like they should be. They are super comfortable, super absorbent and leak proof and super great for the environment. I actually found them because I'm peri-menopausal and have been getting unmanageable heavy flooding that disposable pads have been useless for. In desperation for a solution I came across these. They are not as bulky to wear as they look and are so comfortable you don't notice they are there. Once you've got the hang of how to manage them (which is honestly not as hard as it looks) there is no going back. I shove them in the washing machine on a rinse cycle before putting them in the wash with the rest of my clothes (take that as a tip - you'd be amazed at how much blood they absorb), and then put them in the airing cupboard or on a radiator to dry (they take a while to completely dry out) - and then all good to go. It might be tricky drying these things discretely if you live in a house share :) but I'm sure you'll work it out if you do.

"So I was a little reluctant about these but wanted to do something for the environment. The biggest question I had was what do I do with the wet ones after I've rinsed them and before I am planning to wash them - I assumed they would get smelly if left half full of water. Sooo I cheated a little - I don't know if this is fully advised, but I had 1 pack of the big ones and 1 pack of the small ones, and I just folded them up and put them in the wet bag after I was done with them, and I didn't actually rinse them till the end of my period. I didn't notice any smell from them in this time, in fact I only noticed the smell when I unfolded them to rinse at the end of the week. I also wasn't quite ready to get my hands dirty, so I had a stick with the round disk on the bottom that I just used to ""beat"" them in the water. The good news is I got all the blood out and left no stains and then washed them and they came out great, smelling clean and all. I don't know if they'll last quite as long my way of doing it, but it saves a little of the uncomfortableness of cleaning them. The one thing I would point out which is kind of a given, but not something I had really thought about prior - if you are transferring from regular pads, remember these ones aren't sticky - they only have the button in the middle, which means the ends can move around a bit. I actually use these with some period pants, because I have quite a heavy flow, and the combination definitely works for me - but make sure you are keeping an eye on where they are sitting.","So I was a little reluctant about these but wanted to do something for the environment.

"These are fantastic! I was deliberating about getting these for a while but i'm so glad that I did! I bought 2 boxes of the mix packs, which include 3 large and 3 medium sanitary towels, so 6 of each in total. I suffer with PCOS and generally very heavy periods. My periods usually last 7-8 days, so this was a perfect amount of pads for me. They have great absorbency, so I was going through 3-4 disposable sanitary towels a day, I now go through only 2 of these reusables on my heavy days and 1 on the lighter days. I also suffer with very sensitive skin so get very painful rashes from wearing disposable sanitary towels. I don't have any reactions with these which is amaing!! They wash really easily too! Just soak them in cold water in the sink when you take one off and put a new one on, this just gets rid of the worst of the blood and prevents staining. Wring the pad out and place it in the waterproof section of the wash bag they come with! At the end of your period just chuck them all in the washing machine, you can put the bags in too. I washed mine at 40degrees and they came out perfectly clean. Just don't use any fabric softener as this will decrease the absorbency! The only negative thing I have to say for them, is that because there is no sticky side to stick to your knickers, they can move about about a little bit, BUT, very simple solution, I just bought a roll of double sided body tape (or boob tape!) I put a few centimetres of tape at either end of the pad and it doesn't budge at all!! So overall, great product, saves so much money, much better for sensitive skin and better for the enviroment!!","These are fantastic!

"I've been using these for a few months now, and they're great! A while ago I switched from disposable pads to fancy (...and expensive) period pants, which still remain my ultimate solution for dealing with my period because of how comfortable they are... but at £20ish a pair I don't want to buy too many of them and I want them to last as long as possible.That's where these sanitary towels come in. They are a bit bulkier than the period pants and slightly prone to move around so I avoid wearing them when I'm being very active, but for overnight or times when I'm just lounging around the house then they are ideal. Comfort-wise I'd rate them slightly above disposable towels - I find the fleecy material is a lot nicer to touch, it doesn't have any adhesive to get stuck where it shouldn't, and there's no noisy plastic packaging to open.I've found washing them to be really easy - I just give them a cold rinse after use and store them up in the supplied wet bag until I'm ready put them through the washing machine on a low temperature. I was worried that the fleece material would end up permanently looking like something from a murder scene after the first use, but they ended up as-new after a go in the washer.EDIT: I went to buy some more of these four years later and found out I'd already left a review! So as an update, they are still going strong after four years of use and I think I could definitely keep using them, but I figured that the fleece material was perhaps not as soft as it was so I'd get some fresh ones.","I've been using these for a few months now, and they're great!

Comfort-wise I'd rate them slightly above disposable towels - I find the fleecy material is a lot nicer to touch, it doesn't have any adhesive to get stuck where it shouldn't, and there's no noisy plastic packaging to open.I've found washing them to be really easy - I just give them a cold rinse after use and store them up in the supplied wet bag until I'm ready put them through the washing machine on a low temperature. I was worried that the fleece material would end up permanently looking like something from a murder scene after the first use, but they ended up as-new after a go in the washer.EDIT: I went to buy some more of these four years later and found out I'd already left a review! So as an update, they are still going strong after four years of use and I think I could definitely keep using them, but I figured that the fleece material was perhaps not as soft as it was so I'd get some fresh ones.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0,2020-09-14 00:00:00,2020-09-14,Eco Lily Reusable Sanitary Pads (6Pk for Heavy Flow),Eco
"I've had those pads for 1.5 years and they're great for heavy flow. Not perfect but so far the best I've had compared to the most renown period pants and other pads. And great for milder flows.One of the advantages is that only the inner layers are sewn together in the shape of the pad. The outer layer is only sewn to the rest at the edge. This means blood cannot leak via the seams (if that makes sense).I've had leakage very quickly from pads where all of the layers are sewn together for the shape of the pad and it's extremely frustrating as you need to be changing them more often.These ones need changing as often as you would from thick disposable pads if you have really heavy flow, not so often for milder flows.They're soft and absorbant. Having the fleece all around makes these pads better than the more plastic materials. And they wash really well as long as you soak them before and they don't smell.I'd recommend those pads and will buy them again if mine ever need replacing.","I've had those pads for 1.5 years and they're great for heavy flow.

"After reading the glowing reviews I invested in a pack of 6 large pads to test at night time. I'm in my 30s and have become sick of the waste and damage to my underwear that disposable ones cause. After my initial trial I was so pleased with the results that I bought 2 more packs, this time mixed packs to use during the day.These are so soft, I'd never noticed before how rough regular sanity pads are. The absorbency is great, I'm amazed how much these things can hold. The only icky thing I needed to get over was rinsing them out after use, but it's a small price to pay for comfy and re useable pads.Other reviewers have noted that these can move a little while wearing them, I have also found this but it's never been a problem for me, they are very easy to slip back into place. I used to find that regular sanity towels would move and flip over so these slipping a bit is not a downside of the product for me.I've changed over to using these day and night, I'm a total convert. Yes there are a little pricy but if they last the 5 years they say they will with proper care then they are a bargain in the long run.Another note I'd like to make is the superb customer service, after purchase I received a message of how to properly care for these which I found incredibly helpful.","After reading the glowing reviews I invested in a pack of 6 large pads to test at night time.

"way more comfortable than anything else. these are really thick so it feels like wearing two extra pairs of underwear in one place. the only downside is if you have thin underwear they collapse quite easily meaning they'll just hang off while you're in the bathroom etc which gets quite annoying to reposition, wouldve gone for larger size if i knew itd be as tedious to adjust them all the time as the extra clasp would be helpful even on medium size. i don't wear these outside but they are great for lounging and hold a lot before you need to change. feel so much better than regular disposable and are SO waterproof even rinsing them aggressively the underside stays dry and only ever gets just about damp. would recommend to someone looking to make the change, i was hesitant at first but they have been a nice investment and i look forward to my period sometimes so i can enjoy the extra comfort from my regular underwear lol","way more comfortable than anything else. these are really thick so it feels like wearing two extra pairs of underwear in one place. the only downside is if you have thin underwear they collapse quite easily meaning they'll just hang off while you're in the bathroom etc which gets quite annoying to reposition, wouldve gone for larger size if i knew itd be as tedious to adjust them all the time as the extra clasp would be helpful even on medium size. i don't wear these outside but they are great for lounging and hold a lot before you need to change. feel so much better than regular disposable and are SO waterproof even rinsing them aggressively the underside stays dry and only ever gets just about damp. would recommend to someone looking to make the change, i was hesitant at first but they have been a nice investment and i look forward to my period sometimes so i can enjoy the extra comfort from my regular underwear lol",4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0,2025-02-10 00:00:00,2025-02-10,Eco Lily Reusable Sanitary Pads (6Pk for Medium Flow),Eco
I ordered these during my menstural cycle so needed to use them straight away. Before using them I washed them by hand with cold water and dried them off as directed.I have been using reusable sanitary towels now for a couple of years. And these are by far the best ones I have used. They are extremely comfortable. For me they stay in place so had no issues with that atall. When I first opened them I did think 'wow they are large' but once they are clicked into place in your underwear and worn they are the perfect size. They don't feel too bulky (for me anyway)The design of them are lovely. Love the pattern and colours. The case for them is ideal if you are out and about. And great to store them away ready for next month!Overall I would generally recommend them.,I ordered these during my menstural cycle so needed to use them straight away.

"I've been using reuseable menstrual products or years now, but mainly the mooncup/ organicup prior to this. The problem was that sometimes I didn't want to go to the hassle of washing out the cup and putting it back in multiple times a day because it got to be a painful process with cramps. So I bought these and now use a mix of both. Wow, I wish i had earlier. They are so soft and comfy, with the poppers fastening pretty well. It's worth mentioning I wear really tight underwear and this stops them slipping. The heavy ones really do absorb loads and are great for the heaviest days.Like someone else said, I rinse mine in the shower and so actually handwash in the shower with bar soap then hang to dry. At the end of my period I'll then put them all in the washing machine for a final wash, and I think this method seems to prevent them wearing out so quickly? It's worth mentioning that I keep them flat while washing, and I never wring then out etc. The bags they come with are fab, the two pockets are great. Got to say, being someone who used a mooncup changing these pads in public toilets is MUCH easier than a mooncup! They fold up nicely into a small square when used (secured with poppers) and you can just stuff them in the wetbag.Got to say I also appreciate the black and grey with the purple design- I don't really want to be walking around with bright coloured pads with twee designs on them as a 32 year old woman!Been using them for about 5 months now and they are still fresh and absorbent. I have the pantyliners too and they can also hold a lot. Let's face it it also feels great knowing you aren't polluting the earth with more disposable crap taking absolute years (if it even does at all?) to breakdown...which for me is the best point 👍","I've been using reuseable menstrual products or years now, but mainly the mooncup/ organicup prior to this.

"When I first tried these I thought ""ok they are super bulky and this feels weird!!"" But and a big BUT, you will never feel safer. Nothing is getting past these bad boys.I bought the pack with 3 large and 3 medium. Both sizes can hold heavy flow but ofc, choose the large for these days.How do they hold up compared to disposable:A normal Ultra pad (meant to last 5 hours) would last me max 3 hours (and accidents often occured) in comparison, a large of these reusable pads lasts me half a day and 0 accidents. Ever. Did I mention EVER?Does it smell?Find they smell less than disposables. But it's impossible for anything hold blood for hours and to be odour free.How do I wash them:Ok so it's more work than rolling up your disposable and chucking it in the bin. First time I washed these, they came out of the washing machine still looking dirty but I didn't throw them away. I did some research and ever since they come out of the washing machine looking like new.Step 1: soak in cold water for 30 minStep 2: rinse with cold water will litle blood is coming out of them (takes maybe 10 min when doing all 6?) Rinse and squeeze. Rinse and squeeze.Step 3: there are stains, get a bit of hand soap, squirt it on the pad and rub the pad against itself (or use your hand if you aren't grossed out).Step 4: rinse away the soap, stain should be gone.

"This is the third different brand of cloth sanitary pads that I've bought and it's definitely my favourite. I've been using cloth pads for a couple of years now and wish I'd discovered these earlier. Here's my breakdown:Absorbency: So good I had to remind myself to change them more regularly. The first day I accidentally wore it all day! I also found them very comfortable, no wet feeling at all, even on a heavy day. I had NO LEAKS. Literally none the whole week except for the day I ran out of this style and had to revert to a different brand. BOTH of my other style leaked which just goes to show that the length and size of the Eco Lily's is great.Comfort: There's no denying that if you've never used washable fabric pads before you'll find these bulkier than the disposable kind (unless you bought the cheap homebrand type which feel like footballs). This will initially take some getting used to but it doesn't take long until you forget about it. I found the front of the Eco Lily pads stayed in place really well (hence no leaks) however sometimes it did get a bit bunched up at the back. I have the same problem with other brands I've had though so it might just be my big butt. That is literally my ONLY criticism of this product and cit ertainly wouldn't stop me buying more of them because that sometimes happens with disposable pads too.Cleanliness: I love the grey fabric which means you won't see discolouration of the fabric. My other styles, after a long time of using them, have discoloured now and are a bit unpleasant to look at. That shouldn't happen with the Eco Lily. I found them super easy to rinse after removal and then to handwash with soap later on. The water ran clear much more quickly with this style than my other style which I washed at the same time. I imagine that means it'll clean more effectively in the machine as well.Appearance: I like the purple pattern on the water resistant fabric. It would be nice if they had a range of styles though (like other brands do) because it is fun to have funky fabrics to choose from however let's be honest, it's going straight into our underwear so why does it matter? In summary, I highly recommend this product and will be buying more. Other versions I've seen online can be ridiculously expensive (I even had to pay import duty on some a couple of years ago!) so these are excellent value as well.","This is the third different brand of cloth sanitary pads that I've bought and it's definitely my favourite.

"Firstly let me say I am thrilled that there are so many eco friendly alternatives to standard plastic filled sanitary products and I am here to praise that. So I was really looking forward to using these pads because of reading a lot of previous positive reviews and I was intrigued to see what I would make of them myself. My period usually lasts about 7 days; heavy for the first 3 then significantly reduces and I was genuinely surprised with just how much these pads absorbed! I think I used between 3 and 4 on my heavy days and then down to 2 and just needed 1 on both day 6 and 7. This made me very happy as I was worried about leaking which thankfully did not happen. The pads were easy to rinse under the cold water tap first before washing them through properly on a 30° or 40° cycle. I thought they would be really long, from looking at others pictures but they actually didn't seem that long in reality perhaps just slightly longer than a night pad. The overall look was nice, good quality, packaged nicely, the material was comfortable and soft, the popper was good quality and didn't come undone at any point either. Unfortunately I do have some negative points about the product which could just be my own personal experience but I wanted to give a completely honest review.1. I thought the pad needed an extra popper fastener, there is the option to have a looser or tighter fitting but whilst on the tightest fitting there is no other popper to use, to fasten the extra bit of wing, so it just sort of flaps about and can be annoying.2. I felt the pad wasn't as secure as others had mentioned, it was perhaps the silkly material on the back of the pad which made it more prone to slipping if I wasn't wearing tight trousers.3. I am sad to say that whilst the pads were a soft comfortable material against my skin, they were not comfortable overall whilst active. I went out for a walk wearing one of these and it was the most awful thing. It felt like I had a nappy on, I kept having to rearrange, I was very aware of it being there and it made it far less enjoyable. I will admit when I went for a walk again I swapped the pad for an tampon to avoid the nappy like sensation.I understand not everyone's views will be the same, this was my own personal experience and I do plan on continuing to use these as often as I can. It just means that I will perhaps look into a cup or plastic free tampons for when I'm out and about.","Firstly let me say I am thrilled that there are so many eco friendly alternatives to standard plastic filled sanitary products and I am here to praise that.

Unfortunately I do have some negative points about the product which could just be my own personal experience but I wanted to give a completely honest review.1. I thought the pad needed an extra popper fastener, there is the option to have a looser or tighter fitting but whilst on the tightest fitting there is no other popper to use, to fasten the extra bit of wing, so it just sort of flaps about and can be annoying.2. I felt the pad wasn't as secure as others had mentioned, it was perhaps the silkly material on the back of the pad which made it more prone to slipping if I wasn't wearing tight trousers.3. I am sad to say that whilst the pads were a soft comfortable material against my skin, they were not comfortable overall whilst active. I went out for a walk wearing one of these and it was the most awful thing. It felt like I had a nappy on, I kept having to rearrange, I was very aware of it being there and it made it far less enjoyable. I will admit when I went for a walk again I swapped the pad for an tampon to avoid the nappy like sensation.I understand not everyone's views will be the same, this was my own personal experience and I do plan on continuing to use these as often as I can. It just means that I will perhaps look into a cup or plastic free tampons for when I'm out and about.",4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0,2021-03-19 00:00:00,2021-03-19,Eco Lily Reusable Sanitary Pads (6Pk for Heavy Flow),Eco
"I've been wanting to go plastic-free for a long time, but I've always been nervous because I've had heavy periods all my life. I love the idea of mooncups but I don't like tampons, so I've always known I'd need a non-invasive plastic-free alternative to the sanitary towels I've been using for years. Now that I have these, I'd never go back!Firstly, these towels are so, so comfortable. We get used to having to wear plastic in our pants, but now I have these I wonder how I ever put up with plastic for so long. My periods are so much more comfortable now, I don't have plastic sticking to my thighs or anywhere else, and these towels barely move at all either.There can be some movement, but it all depends on the kind of underwear you wear. I tend to wear my tighter-fitting underwear during my period now that I have these towels and they never move, and they've also never moved while I've been asleep either which is pretty amazing - I fall asleep on my front but I always wake up on my back, so there's plenty of opportunity for them to move around! I haven't had any leaks either, which amazes me considering I often leaked when I was using plastic sanitary towels and often ended up having to wear two at a time.These towels are easy enough to clean, too - I shove them in the washing machine at 30 degrees for around 20-30 minutes and then dry them overnight on my radiator and they're ready to be used again. I have noticed there can be some staining, but the towel is clean, so I think I might try soaking them in cold water before I wash them which the box recommends to avoid staining.I also think these would be wonderful for anyone who's just started their period - particularly younger people who start their period while they're in school. A zip-up bag comes in the box for your used towels until you can get home to wash them, and I think they'd be so much more discreet for any school-age person who's perhaps nervous about starting their period. I wish I'd known these were an option when I was 12 years old!They're comfortable, absorbent and so much better for the environment - what's not to love?","I've been wanting to go plastic-free for a long time, but I've always been nervous because I've had heavy periods all my life.

"My daughter is at the age her first period could start anytime. She carries a pack of sanitary towels in her school bag ""just in case""Thinking back to my own experience of my first period, it was actually quite traumatising. I flow heavily each time and can be in agonising pain with cramps as well as lower back pain. Other than a talk at school informing girls there was only 2 products on the market, pads or tampons. Little other information was given. So the amount of blood and the pain I was in, I literally thought something was seriously wrong and I was dying!Not wanting this for my daughter, I'm completely open with her and she is comfortable in asking me all kinds of questions.One of the biggest bugbear of mine, is how wet I feel with every pad and constantly needing to change. Self conscious about leakage was a particular worry when I was at school, scared all the boys could see and smell the blood.I hate pads with a passion and I've never felt tampons are appropriate for a young girl first starting out so I looked into seeing if there is anything new on the market.Of course you can buy period underwear, but most say to be worn in conjunction with pads/tampons. Which kind of defeats the purpose.My sister-in-law told me she uses a moon cup. But like tampons, not sure it's ideal for my daughter. But then I came across the reusable eco lily pads. I read reviews which were great but everyone is different right? Best way to really test them is using them myself.Omg! I wish these was available when I was a girl. I have felt so dry through out, they're so comfortable to wear and never moved. Best of all, far few changes needed. I could easily get through 3-4 packs of towels for a 5 day period. However, I have only used 2 towels a day! One in the morning that lasts through the day and a change before bed.So easy to clean, does not smell and no irritation as the material is so soft against your skin, unlike disposable pads that can cause nappy rash!I will be donating my daughters school bag pack to a Womens homeless shelter and I will be buying her eco lily instead for when she starts. I've already talked her through what to do with them and shes ready but also excited as in her words ""they look cool""I honestly believe eco lily will help my daughters first period a much more pleasant experience than my traumatic experience in the 90's.","My daughter is at the age her first period could start anytime.

"I have been considering switching to reusable sanitary products for many months now, so I bought these on a whim when my preferred brand of disposables was unavailable. I have previously tried a few different cups with no avail, so cloth pads seemed like the way to go!I bought a box each of the regular and large/heavy flow size, which is more than enough to get me through my period. I'd say that the medium size is equivalent to most disposables, whereas the heavy flow pads are more the size of maternity towels. Otherwise there is not a huge amount of difference, besides an extra popper on the large ones.These pads are extremely comfortable to wear, and easy to attach to using the poppers. They're very soft, and they don't bunch up or move around too much. I've experienced no leakage whatsoever, even on my heaviest days, and I've found that these pads feel much drier in between changes. They can hold a lot! For this reason I'm having to change less often, which eases the burden on washing them.Cleaning them is easy - just rinse with cold water, then wash on a 30° cycle without any conditioner. I usually leave mine in a tub of cold water until I have enough to wash together. They come out looking good as new, which I'm sure the dark grey colour helps with!I especially like that each pack includes a waterproof travel bag, with a separate space for your wet and dry pads, so it's easy to change on the go.Overall, I'm really pleased with these and I definitely won't be going back to disposables. These are more comfortable, more absorbent, more cost effective in the long run, and much less damaging to the environment. The only way they could be improved is if all sizes included the 2 poppers, as I can get a much better fit that way.","I have been considering switching to reusable sanitary products for many months now, so I bought these on a whim when my preferred brand of disposables was unavailable.

"I wanted to love these, but they just didn't hit the mark for me. Here's why:Cons:-Very thick, to the point you can see them through even a thick pair of jeans, so you're limited in what you can wear.-Very warm fabric, makes your hooha sweaty and doesn't let the area breathe, this results in you feeling really uncomfortable and hot down there.-The biggest con is the fact they aren't wide enough. There are 2 sets of adjustable buttons, and I was so shocked to see the 'loosest' button was still quite tight. You need to be wearing panties that have a very thin gusset so that the buttons can clip comfortably underneath without creating a bulge. I know most women tend to wear comfier loser panties when on their period due to pain and bloating, but it seems these pads were made to be put on top of a thong or something similar. I'd say this was the biggest con for me.-They slide back and forth and need to be 'adjusted' at times.-Really unpleasant charcoal type smell even after washing several times as the instructions state, the smell would make me sick, this is before even using them.-Blood clots remain sitting on top and aren't absorbed the way they are with traditional pads.-Washing these pads is very tedious and sort of gross. You can't place them directly in the washing machine without hand washing first, but doing that was a bit gnarly for me - period blood is not something a person enjoys touching or seeing running down my sink. Plus it was time consuming to wash, especially if you're a busy mother like me who also works full time and has a thousand other things going on, washing these pads before putting in the machine was an added chore.PROS-Great long length-Can hold an impressive amount of fluid.After using these for 3 cycles and really trying to enjoy the benefits of saving money on pads and not being exposed to harmful chemicals with traditional pads, I decided they weren't for me, so I actually threw them away a few days ago. It's a shame because I genuinely really wanted to like these.Hope this review helps!","I wanted to love these, but they just didn't hit the mark for me.

"So I've actually been using these for two years now and finally got round to writing a review.In my two years of using these I can honestly say they look as good as new! Yes, they're a different way of thinking about periods and hygiene but there are so many benefits of using these.1) I have found these really absorbent and as someone who suffers with heavy periods, I have no longer had any flooding incidents.2) although a little bulky to wear, they're quite comfortable and not smelly at all.3) I like the fact I'm helping the environment! No more disposable used pads in landfill.4) they're surprisingly easy to clean. What I have found over the years is keeping a little bin (with a lid) that sits next to my loo, filled with cold water to store the used ones in. I give them a rinse before they go in the bin to get the excess blood out. But I actually don't bother if I'm out and about! If I'm about to shower, it sits in the bottom of the shower to rinse before going in my cold water bin!4) you get a handy water proof pouch to pop them in. When I get home, they go in my water filled bin.5) when I'm ready, they go in my washing machine and come out as good as new. They go in my tumble dryer too! Every month after they've been in the machine, I do run a cleaning cycle as I then know I'm keeping my machine clean!6) I've saved money!! Yes they're an initial outlay, but before long you've got your money back.No downsides really, and I'm glad I've switched to these. I would 100% recommend!","So I've actually been using these for two years now and finally got round to writing a review.In my two years of using these I can honestly say they look as good as new!

"They're quite absorbant but I've only used one so far, as I'm a little nervous using it at night but will try and I will update the review in due course.They're quite comfy and not that thick when you compare to maternity pads which in my opionion are quite thick.Update February 2023So I've had a few cycles since buying (October 2022) and they are really great. I used to go through 2packs of the disposable liners (I would wear the night liners as I felt more protection from them. I would change my pad every four hours during the heaviest days my period.The reusable pads are great because the only thing I have to worry about is making sure I have a clean set for my next cycle but that's easy as I have a regular laundry routine and just throw them in with my clothes after I have hand-washed them.They may take some getting used to especially if you're coming from the thin disposable pads because they're quite thick, especially the heavy pads compared to the regular flow pads.During my heaviest flow days I now wear the regular flow pads when I'm out and about, I'm normally out for about 5 hours and I walk to all my destinations so it lasts all that time, however I used to wear the heavy flow ones initially when I went out and about because I thought that the extra protection was needed but it is not the case. If I was going to be doing a lot of sitting down I would wear the heavy pads as I tend bleed to the back and its just better protection for me.I've only had one bleedthrough and that was my own fault because I didn't change my pad before going to bed as I was exhausted but even then it was a small amount of spotting on my clothes instead of well the mess that usually occurs when you bleed through.Another big bonus is that I no longer get a rash, I used to always get a rash whenever I used disposable pads, it would be by the crease of my thigh and vulva, not sure why I would get a rash but ever since going reusable I've not had a rash, which is a big relief.I have purchased another pack to make it a total of 6 heavy flow pads and 6 regular flow pads as although I was managing with just 3 regular and 3 heavy flow I'd have to wash them as soon as I changed one otherwise I'd have one less for the next day if that makes sense, at least this way I can rinse them and put them in the wash bag until laundry day as I do laundry for the household twice a week. If you're curious about cloth pads I definitely recommend you buy the 3+3 heavy/regular combination so you have a nice mix.I wash mine on a 40degree wash because I do not have the patience to be messing around with buttons to adjust the temperature on a wash to 30degrees.I will eventually be buying 100% pure cotton pads from somebody that actually makes cloths pads but they're quite expensive and your period isn't going to wait until you have the funds to buy the nice cloth pads.As much as I wanted to stop using plastic (microfiber is a plastic) the fact that I've gone from single use plastic to reusable is a start and I think if you're curious about whether cloth pads are for you then this is a great way to find out as they're with you within a couple of days because amazon instead of whatever the 2-3week wait whilst your order is created and then another wait for it to be delivered.

"I've never had children but am approaching the pesky perimenopausal years where no sanitary pad is man enough to do the job unless you're prepared to use tampons alongside the pad, which is what I do. Even the Infinity Always pad doesn't stand up to my flow and I get leaks. I bought these as having skipped a couple of periods and my period has just started so I am expecting a deluge. Opened them today and laughed at how big they are, put one in my knickers and, yes, it does feel like you're wearing a nappy but they are comfortable and soft and I immediately felt secure. I will write an update when I know if these will stand up to Aunt Flo. UPDATE: So having come to the end of Auntie Flo I found that these didn't stay stuck to the inside of my underwear for more than a day before they came unstuck and started bunching up at the back. They leaked at the side a little but like I said I was expecting a heavier period so I was half expecting some...mess. I think I will probably use these for the first couple of days in the future and then switch down to an Always or Bodyform pad afterwards.","I've never had children but am approaching the pesky perimenopausal years where no sanitary pad is man enough to do the job unless you're prepared to use tampons alongside the pad, which is what I do.

"I don't know, ladies, why people are complaining about these. 3 days out of hospital, still needing proper cover for the region in discussion, these are the ones I started using as soon as I could get off the bed and reach my hospital bag (well, suitcase), despite the hospital providing some other ones which were narrower and leaked all over the bed, clothes, body.To use simple language and speak the reality, maternity pads, you want them BIG.

These are; 2nd, 3rd, and, especially, 1st time around you don't want to spend those 5 precious minutes and last of your iron and energy washing something so messy. Yes, they don't have wings and manage to leak a tiny bit, but remember the days when we had to use pads every month, those were never perfect, were they?And, as with all 'intrusive' objects, there will be a bit of soreness to the nearby area, but all pads cause that, and it's not the pad but the experience, so just remember, it all goes, and it takes time, and YOU WILL BE GOOD AS NEW, although it definitely does not seem so at this time. Just breathe, relax, feed the baby, change their nappies, have warm relaxing showers, a bit of favourite sweets, some lovely tea, give other participating parties a hug and remember how you felt on your very best day: that will soon happen again. You will get there.2 weeks later, these are still steady favourites after a week with winged Cottons and the ones from the local store. Cannot fault them in any way, should have bought 10 packs in the first place.And now, nearly 3 months later, and looking back, these were still the best ones. They do have rivals, Boots have very similar pads but theirs are slightly bigger, with a smaller, interrupted 'stick-on' area; however Boots sell theirs 50p cheaper, which might make a difference if you need them for 2 months like myself.Yes, and you are not using them to soak them up.

"I bought these for my postpartum and to be honest, I think they were overall great.The pads are very big, like, really; which is also what you need during that first week of postpartum... their thickness helps cushion the area when you sit, which is perfect if you have stitches. The texture is very soft, much softer than any other pad, however because of this, you also don't get the same level of absorption in the pad. Since you have to change pads very often, this is not a problem. Also, the fact that the lochia won't be completely filtered in the pads helps you observe the colour of it; which is important information to report to your midwife.After using a whole pack, I moved to another brand given that I didn't need such big pads anymore. I do recommend these pads at least for the first postpartum week.

So I brought these for after I'd had my baby they were extremely comfortable they gave full coverage along side of the nets I brought off here to go with too so I didn't have to worry about any leaking we're better than just having a small maternity pad in knickers they made me feel secure would recommend to any mum to use these after birth also soft on sore areas too :),So I brought these for after I'd had my baby they were extremely comfortable they gave full coverage along side of the nets I brought off here to go with too so I didn't have to worry about any leaking we're better than just having a small maternity pad in knickers they made me feel secure would recommend to any mum to use these after birth also soft on sore areas too :),5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0,2024-07-22 00:00:00,2024-07-22,"ABENA Premium Maternity Pads, Postpartum Essentials, Eco-Labelled, Extra Protection, After Birth, Breathable and Skin Friendly, Sustainable Incontinence Pads - 15PK",ABENA

"I've had the most horrid time trying to find a pad in the U.K that could help with my heavy periods. Imagine my relief and joy when I found these pads. Not only do they help with containing the flow but with the strong absorption ability it gives a dry feel. This is something we women need, it helps get rid of that icky damp cold touch that some of the best pads in the market cannot achieve. Hence I gave it 5 stars. One tiny drawback is the thin adherence sticky strip that's just okay and could be made better. However it has no negative impact on the functioning of the pad.","I've had the most horrid time trying to find a pad in the U.K that could help with my heavy periods.

I bought these because of heavy periods due to endometriosis. Even the super absorbent period pads don't work but these do. I pair with postpartum underwear and it is very good! These are unscented and breathable meaning they don't irritate the skin. I love how even with periods they don't have any odour like some other incontinence wear does when used in a period setting. They are also cheaper and a lot better. These are a staple for me now! I wish they done some with wings as I do wriggle when I sleep and they sometimes displace around that area at the crotch. But they are a lot wider and longer than period pads and definitely thicker! Very happy,I bought these because of heavy periods due to endometriosis.

"These were great for use immediately after childbirth. The size of the pads is super large but this is what makes it perfect for the heavy blood flow immediately post birth. I've knocked off one star as they don't have wings which meant that I had some very minor leakages at the side of the pads which ended up causing some blood to get onto my pants. This was ok given that I was wearing disposables but if they had wings they literally would be perfect. Other than that that the absorption, size and comfort were all fabulous and I would definitely recommend post birth.

"I've never had children but am approaching the pesky perimenopausal years where no sanitary pad is man enough to do the job unless you're prepared to use tampons alongside the pad, which is what I do.

UPDATE: So having come to the end of Auntie Flo I found that these didn't stay stuck to the inside of my underwear for more than a day before they came unstuck and started bunching up at the back. They leaked at the side a little but like I said I was expecting a heavier period so I was half expecting some...mess.

"Very impressed with these sanitary towels. These are by far the softest and most pleasant feeling pads I've ever used - and this is having tried many different brands. The cotton really does make a difference with how it feels against the skin, even though I was skeptical at first. More environmentally friendly, breathable and without any fragrance, they also have a good level of absorption whilst not being too thick. I would say the glue is stickier than other mainstream brands I've used (eg Always), but they still peel off cleanly (instead of leaving strips of plastic like some do!) You can't fault them for their performance and I would 100% repurchase.","Very impressed with these sanitary towels.

"I've been switching gradually to more eco-conscious period care, and these Naty sanitary towels have genuinely impressed me. Despite being fully compostable and made without any plastic, they perform just as reliably as the mainstream brands. The cotton topsheet feels soft and breathable against the skin --- no irritation, no itchiness, and no artificial fragrance trying to disguise anything.They're slim yet absorbent, stay securely in place throughout the day, and the leak protection is surprisingly good even on heavier flow days. The individual paper wrappers are discreet and recyclable, which is a thoughtful touch.It's great to see a brand taking sustainability seriously without compromising comfort or performance. If you're looking to make a simple swap that's kinder to both your body and the environment, these are well worth trying.","I've been switching gradually to more eco-conscious period care, and these Naty sanitary towels have genuinely impressed me.

"These pads (Super with Wings) are a breath of fresh air compared to traditional pads, which tend to contain irritating synthetic fragrances and plastic.In contrast, these are really comfortable, and soft to wear. They also don't make crinkling noises like plastic ones. They also don't feel bulky to wear, and feel discreet. The general adhesive sticks to my underwear superbly, and the wings totally keep the pad from moving.I really like that there's no added fragrances to these pads, as they just aren't needed. I have sensitive skin, and I feel far less irritated and itchy using these than the mainstream brands.They're much kinder to my allergies, and I've even noticed I sweat less when wearing them.Personally, I haven't experienced any cotton shedding, though my day-to-day activities aren't overly active.Overall, the absorbency is decent. For very heavy flows, I'd probably want a bit more protection, but they're great for the average to heavy period. My favourite time to wear these is at night for extra peace of mind. To conclude, I'd definitely order this brand of pads again.","These pads (Super with Wings) are a breath of fresh air compared to traditional pads, which tend to contain irritating synthetic fragrances and plastic.In contrast, these are really comfortable, and soft to wear.

"We use Naty nappies for our baby so I was curious to try these pads for myself. Naty brand produces good quality products with fairly good eco credentials, these pads are no exception. They use Oeko-tex certified 'fabrics'and responsibly sourced forest pulp. Many materials are compostable and no plastic touches the skin. I like that the manufacturer clearly describes what materials have been used to make these pads (unlike many other manufacturers). I think that it is important to treat the skin in this part of the body with care and respect as it is thinner and more sensitive.I mostly use period pants but I got these pads to use in an emergency and/or in addition to my period pants. I can't comment on the absorbency/leaks as I haven't been able to try the pads just yet (postpartum). However they do appear to be soft and nice to use.","We use Naty nappies for our baby so I was curious to try these pads for myself.

"I've tried a couple of different brands of resusable pads before, and personally I find ecolily the best. The pads are very absorbent - I could go through the night without needing to change, with no overflow, and the pads don't feel heavy even when full. The fleece extends across the whole pads including the wings, which is great because unlike others, it means it doesn't stain across the sides. The fleece is comparatively thicker than on some other brands so these pads can seem a bit bulky at first, but I personally find that more secure because I know I don't need to worry about leaking. They're very comfortable and easy to clean, just rinse them in cold water then pop them in the wash without fabric softener, and tumble dry.The only downside I would say is that the carry bag it comes with isn't large enough to hold all 6 pads at the same time, so it wouldn't be practical if you couldn't use washing facilities every day. But if you're just at home/school/work, then they're definitely a brand worth checking out.","I've tried a couple of different brands of resusable pads before, and personally I find ecolily the best.

"Made the transition to reusable pads and if you're also considering it I can highly recommend this brand - I ordered medium and large and they are sized really well. The large is similar to the Bodyform Nightime pads but far softer, more comfortable and doesn't have the itchiness of a disposable pad. You don't have to worry about these leaking through, they are thick without being bulky and they seem to be made with care.The buttons are a lot more secure than the shoddy adhesive on disposables. The only downside to all reusable pads is that you need to wash them, however this isn't a big issue given that you're saving money and it's also way more comfortable to wear these compares to disposables. Yes it's a much bigger cost upfront but it's absolutely worth it, these also don't contain the same nasty ingredients that disposable pads and tampons do.","Made the transition to reusable pads and if you're also considering it I can highly recommend this brand - I ordered medium and large and they are sized really well.

"They are comfy on the skin. The 1st time I used them, they were moving too much on the panties and I got spotting.. here some tips:I would reccomend to use them with tight panties, the ones i was using that day were not so the pad was moving.The absorb a lot for sure, even the smaller ones. Easy to clean, just wash in the sink with cold water till the water gets clean and after in the washing machine.No smell at all, and when they're dirty you can fold them and keep them in you bag inside their little black bag that arrives together with the pads. I couldn't fit them all in that bag tho, but when you are not home for work or for the day, you don't need to bring them all. In general, I feel satisfied of it and of my decision to not to use the normal pads anymore. I bought them cause I didn't want the normal pads to irritate my skin, these one are soft and they feel good","They are comfy on the skin.

"I've been trying to change to eco sanitary products for over a year. I tried the cup but didn't get on with it (or a few options actually). Then when the covid19 pandemic caused all the shops to run out of my usual sanitary pads I found these... I was sceptical at first, but wow these are a game changer. I'm so pleased I invested in these. They are so much more comfortable than regular pads (that used to give me a rash). I don't like tampons as I can't get on with them so pads are all I use. They're super absorbant. They feel great against my skin. They are a little thicker than a regular pad, but you get used to it. It's like having a soft plush pillow between your legs! Washing is easy, just bung them in the machine (unfolded) and run on a normal wash (no more than 40 degrees) but don't add fabric softener. Then they go in the tumble dryer on a synthetic (lower heat) cycle and they're done. They are brilliant. No waste and no rashes. I highly recommend these. They might get a bit warm in summer with them being thicker but it's a small price to pay to save my skin! If you were umming an ahhing about buying these, don't. Just get them. They are an investment worth getting. Big thumbs up!","I've been trying to change to eco sanitary products for over a year. I tried the cup but didn't get on with it (or a few options actually).

Washing is easy, just bung them in the machine (unfolded) and run on a normal wash (no more than 40 degrees) but don't add fabric softener. Then they go in the tumble dryer on a synthetic (lower heat) cycle and they're done. They are brilliant. No waste and no rashes. I highly recommend these. They might get a bit warm in summer with them being thicker but it's a small price to pay to save my skin! If you were umming an ahhing about buying these, don't. Just get them. They are an investment worth getting.

"I suffer from the most horrendous heavy periods. Using 6 nighttime pads a night usually and leaking onto the bed. Then I was told by some friends to use an adult nappy as I was so heavy. I cannot usually leave the house first and second day as it's so bad. I usually go through 15 pads on those days. Today I used my first Eco Pad! Only 1, no leak, even looked like there was no bleeding. It's so comfortable and I felt assured it wasn't going to leak. Washed it straight away and I was amazed how much it contained. I'm totally converted and now telling all my girlfriends who suffer with heavy periods. One of the best investments I've ever made!","I suffer from the most horrendous heavy periods.

"These pads are lovely and soft, they don't give you that nasty rash that towels do. The heavy ones would work fine a woman with a normal period, but they do not provide enough protection if you have developed fibroids and are losing up to 200mls plus per flood. They are lovely and comfy though. Worth it for normal flow. I will use these again for day 3-6 but not for first 3 days.","These pads are lovely and soft, they don't give you that nasty rash that towels do.

"These are great, Ive used them for 2 months now and don't think I'd go back to normal pads. I could go like 8 hours without changing the pad on a heavy period and it doesn't leak through, it absorbs really well, it's hard to tell sometimes if its full as it doesn't have that wet, sitting in a puddle feeling like normal pads but if left on too long can get that period smell. They're pretty easy to clean. I usually just rinse it while i have a shower until the water runs clear and then squeeze a bit of soap on it and rinse it then stick it in with the washing and usually use an antibacterial liquid that will make sure everything is sanitised and wont hold on to smells. They are much more comfortable than a normal pad, it doesn't really move once in position but if it does its easy to adjust it. Not like normal pads where if you put it in the wrong place its hard to adjust it after and feels like wearing a nappy. This just feels like sitting on a cloud. Not sure if this particular make do already but would be great if they had different colours for females living in the same house doing washing together.","These are great, Ive used them for 2 months now and don't think I'd go back to normal pads.

"I truly love these. I was apprehensive at first. This is my 2nd cycle using them and they're so comfy. I don't get aggravated in bed anymore cos of itchy pads or tampons messing up my ph and making sore. These reusable pads just feel like soft underwear I love them. BUT, they are starting to get a little smell to them, and this is only my 2nd month wearing em. I know it says to rinse on cold, but I put them on 40 wash, with antibacterial wash, and they smell better after that. I aired them too after drying them in tumble dryer, then lay flat on my bedroom windowsill with window open. The 40 wash didn't damage them or anything. Sometimes you need hot water to kill the musty smells you get me. Happy vagina 👍","I truly love these. I was apprehensive at first. This is my 2nd cycle using them and they're so comfy.

"I was having to change my premium brand disposable maxi pads every hour on my heaviest days resulting me using over 10 a day. Not good really, I decided to try some reusable pads to go with my branded reusable period pants (as changing whole pants can be annoying in the day) and settled on these after seeing a customer review on youtube.These dont give as much absorbency as I was hoping, however they last an hour longer than the maxi disposables, so for me that is a win!I have bought two packs of these to keep me going through my heavy days. They can take a while to dry (though not as long as my super heavy flow period pants) and its best to rinse them out then soak then in water until you come to washing them with your usual laundry. This way they dont stain or start to smell due to being left wet for too long.","I was having to change my premium brand disposable maxi pads every hour on my heaviest days resulting me using over 10 a day.

"When the pack description said heavy/ maternity I was cautiously optimistic, I purchased my first pack at the end of Jan to test out, and they have been washed multiple times I found them to be comfortable and feel confident wearing no accidents and no unpleasentness/soreness to deal with as you find with disposable I have a few others from a different brand for a daily option, but these are what I would use along with cup when the event shows up depending on the heaviness/activity planned for the day. Would I recommend absolutely have I just received two more packs yes. May not be 100% plastic free but a heck of a lot better for you and the environment than disposable options, and these can be recycled at the end of there life.

"So my first time using these I'm fed up of throwing money in the bin (i know there not much), ruining knickers where the normal pads super stick & rip them & I'm getting a bit more eco friendly. (I'm middle of period when starting these to test from normal pads) instructions easy except for the under side has the logo but doesn't state if back or front but I prefer back but I dont think there is a right or wrong. So I liked the dark colour underneath which feels soft & silky like a swim suit material. The pad (extra long) is thicker than my usual pad but you dont notice it. They have 2 poppers to select the width of your panties which is good (big girl). The pad fabric is soft, like a thin sheepskin blanket. It comes with a 2 pocket bag so one fresh one used. I have not had any smell until I decided to wipe the pad which then it did. I do feel fresh & forget I've got it on. They can slide a little but not enough for concern. I've cleaned them by rinsing in cold water until the water runs clear this is when you realise how much fluid the pad has held/soaked up. I put them on the air to dry.in final picture you can see they dry great back to normal.You can put in machine on cold wash, no detergent & dryer on low heat. On my first 2 days I went through 15 pads then 2 eco pads a day. I wish i knew about these a long time ago.","So my first time using these I'm fed up of throwing money in the bin (i know there not much), ruining knickers where the normal pads super stick & rip them & I'm getting a bit more eco friendly.

"I've actually just ordered a second set. I bought my first set 10/11 months ago. I love them. So much more comfortable than disposable ones and more absorbent. They don't need changed as often as disposable ones too. Easy to wash, I just put them in the washing machine and then dry them on the rack or on the radiator. The ones I bought originally are still perfect I just wanted more as sometimes I'm waiting for one to dry after being washed before I can change it. It's worth the money. They stay out very well too.

"Overall I really like these pads. I have heavy flow and the absorbency is amazing and had zero leaks. They are also very comfortable as the liquid gets wicked away from skin. However, they can slide around in my pants and I need to readjust them regularly, so I tend to use them at home rather than at work or when out and about. The heavy flow pads are fairly bulky but no worse than standard maxi pads really. Don't know how they will feel in warm weather as the fabric is thick and like fleece, so they may be a bit warm in a heat wave. Very easy to wash and found the waterproof bag very useful. Overall, I am satisfied and will probably get some more in the future","Overall I really like these pads. I have heavy flow and the absorbency is amazing and had zero leaks.

"These are an absolute god send! If you ever get itchy or leak with disposable pads, please give these a try! I bleed heavily and was forever leaking even with a night-time disposable pad and it would still go everywhere. Now I just use one of these Mediums, with some period underwear and no more spills. I think the fuzzy material stops it from shifting too much compared to other pads, so it stays and catches what it needs to.Washing them out is a breeze, just rinse them under cold water and toss them in the washer. I've only used them for 2 cycles and I no longer have any irritation, or sweating either.They're also super comfortable on, not bulky or makes you feel as if you're wearing a pad at all.10/10","These are an absolute god send!

"These are soo comfy and I've had no problems with them moving around. The extra long ones are great for nights as they prevent any leakages. The grey side which I believe is the side you use is a nice fleece material so is very soft and doesn't cause any rubbing.They have a great absorbency as I have always experienced heavy flows and normally go through 5 pads in the day and 2-3 during the night. However I only need to use one of these during the day and one of the longer ones at night time.When washing I leave them to soak in cold salted water to prevent staining for about an hour then just put them on the 30 minute 30 degrees Celsius setting, I don't use any conditioner/softener as this can affect the absorbency of the pads. And then I just hang them to dry as I don't think you're supposed to tumble dry these.They're amazing and I only wish I bought them sooner, I will never go back to disposable pads as these are better for the environment and your body without all of the nasty chemicals that can do god knows what to your feminine health.

"Used for a second month now. No problems at all. On my heaviest day I've worn a tampon for part of the day but to be honest that was 'just in case', I think next month I won't bother. I've got 2 packs of the largest size, a pack of medium and one pack of light. Plenty to get through the 5/6 days for me 😊.I rinse them until the water pretty much runs clear and they then either go straight in a wash or in a wet bag until I put a wash on. Yes you have to rinse and squeeze out blood which on heavy days isn't the most pleasant job but it really doesn't take long. So worth it for the comfort and massive reduction in plastic waste!They definitely absorb more than even the biggest disposable pad. Almost makes your flow appear lighter.They don't leak and are easy to use out and about with the wet bag.If you're at all sceptical then just wear them in the house at first to get used to them, and if you're worried when using themOut the house for the first time, either combine with tampons initially or just bring disposables as back ups.I don't think you'll regret giving them a go.Just make sure you have good fitting underwear when wearing the smaller pads as they can move around a bit.","Used for a second month now.

"Purchased these sanitary pads as was looking for something comfortable and to stop buying disposable pads. The pretty dark design is nice and discreet and they fit into panties well and secure easily in place with the popper. Like the little bag to store them in until they are ready to be washed, as keeps odours and mess at bay. The pads are easy to clean, just rinse and then put them in the washing machine. These pads are fine for light to medium days, but found they are not great for heavy flow as advertised, as they are a bit short in length and not wide enough which causes pad to leak slightly. Also for particularly heavy flow they could definitely benefit from being longer in length and wider at the back to save any leakages. Will look to buy some more reusable pads which are longer and wider for those heavier days and nights. Overall happy with purchase. Nice pads of good value and quality.","Purchased these sanitary pads as was looking for something comfortable and to stop buying disposable pads.

Not only has it completely reduced my use of tampos and pads, of which are very bad for the environment, I no longer get the skin rashes that normally come with the pads that most often aren't talked about.It does to be fair feel like a cinder block in your pants at first (though this does not mean they are uncomfortable by any mean, they are just noticeably thicker and bigger than pads) because it is very thick but it gets the job done and there are medium strength ones anyways so to each their own. Rest assured when you sleep, no matter what position you pull, blood will not escape this beast. 100% very good purchase, will be buying more.My recommendation if you get heavy flow regularly on periods, go for the heavy flow one as it really can capture all of your waste. I also wear it outside of period to catch discharge because it's just that comfortable to wear and protects my sensitive skin from non-cotton underwear at times and chafing.","Ladies, please go for this.

"This pack of 6 lasted me from the afternoon of day 1 to the evening of day 2, which is about the same as disposables for me. The fleecy upper material is soft and very comfortable, and I didn't find them bulky at all. Absorbency seems good, but perhaps not as quick to wick away wetness. I did notice a slight smell, I suspect the chemicals in disposable pads usually control this. No problems with leaking or moving.I used these 6 pads, then switched back to disposables whilst I set about washing them. I put them in a plastic bathroom bin and rinsed with cold water. I'm not squeamish but I did find this a little unpleasant. Then in the washing machine on 40 degrees for an hour, with normal detergent. They air dry quickly. I put them in with the bath mat, I didn't fancy mixing with clothes.On the whole a positive experience. I will give another cycle's trial before I purchase another set of 6. Main negatives for me are the rinsing (I may try skipping this step), smell (natural but slightly unpleasant) and not being able to monitor how much I'm bleeding (difficult to see or tell).","This pack of 6 lasted me from the afternoon of day 1 to the evening of day 2, which is about the same as disposables for me.

"I was a bit hesitant making the move from disposables to reusables, but based on previous reviews I decided to give Eco Lily a go. I purchased one pack in my first order (3x large & 3x medium), which were so good that I immediately ordered another 6x medium & 6x light pads. The large and medium are very good, super absorbent and very comfortable. They fit and stay in place perfectly and hold a lot more than disposable pads. I am a lot more confident wearing these cloth pads that haven't leaked once, (compared to disposables that would leak on occasion and you'd often feel like you to need pop to the bathroom to 'go and check'). The first time I wore one I thought it felt a bit bulkier than a disposable, but I very soon got used to it and decided that I preferred this extra feeling of comfort and confidence that I was well covered anyway.That said, the small/light pads are not as good. They are still very absorbent, but they do not stay in place as well as the medium/large. Probably because they are smaller and have less 'bulk/length' behind them to stop them sliding up/down your underwear with just the popper behind it. I did have to keep pulling it up every time I went to the bathroom. I have decided to use the large/medium most of the time and only use the light for the last very light day as just a back-up. But honestly, if you are considering reusable cloth pads then Eco Lily large/medium is a great option.","I was a bit hesitant making the move from disposables to reusables, but based on previous reviews I decided to give Eco Lily a go.

"I got a package of 3 large, and 3 medium and honesty I did not take out a ruler to visualize the size before purchase... but I was a bit shocked about the large-sized ones. They are ENOURMOUS and I don't consider them fit to wear during the day with normal trousers. I use them at night now. In terms of absorbency, I was really positively surprised. The surface looks and feels like a soft fleece sweater (is therefore very comfortable on the skin and feels MUCH nicer than common throw-away large pads surface) which I did not expect to take in liquid so well. I was sceptical at first but felt absolutely safe the second time wearing them. I rinsed them cold and washed them at 30 degrees then and they come out as new.","I got a package of 3 large, and 3 medium and honesty I did not take out a ruler to visualize the size before purchase... but I was a bit shocked about the large-sized ones.

"I just had to write a review about these sanitary pads, they are truly life changing. I didn't expect them to be as good as they are and so felt it necessary to write an in depth review.These arrived well packaged and I ordered 6 of the heavy flow pads as I tend to have two or three very heavy days.I was very impressed at how these pads kept me dry and comfortable during very heavy days. I used to use the disposable pads which had an annoying floral smell which impregnated my underwear. I hated it. These pads have no odour at all, even when saturated. They are soft and warm, but on a hot day, do not make you feel sweaty or uncomfortable.The pads are fleecy, and very easy to clean. I just ran under cold water immediately after removing it, and then once the water runs clear, I switched to warm water, used a little castille soap and washed the whole pad by hand. Then I wrung it out and left to air on an airer.I'm not squeamish about blood, so you may want to put in the washing machine, but they are so easy to clean by hand.They seem well made, the stitching is very nice and the material is good quality.Overall, I'm really happy to have found these. I'm putting less plastic into the environment and spending less overall too. Win win!","I just had to write a review about these sanitary pads, they are truly life changing.

"I have been thinking of trying a reusable pad for some time but was totally clueless which brand to try. I can across these whilst isolating having got covid. My time of the month happened earlier than expected and I kept forgetting to add some sanitary towels to my supermarket delivery. I ordered these on Amazon as they had next day delivery and I was about to run out. When they arrived, I was a bit anxious about a reusable pad but then thought it is no different to a Terry type nappy we wore as babies so would be fine. I gave it a try thinking I was not leaving home for a while so could quickly shower if there was a problem with leakage. However, I was extremely surprised how absorbent the pad was. It also felt soft, warm and fluffy rather than the horrible cold plastic which often makes you feel sore. The pads are easy to clean and I will probably invest in some more next month so I have 2 sets to use. I wish I had found this product years ago. Looking forward to saving money in the future and helping to save the planet.","I have been thinking of trying a reusable pad for some time but was totally clueless which brand to try.

"So if you're like me, and disposible sanitary pads irritate your body, make you feel uncomfortable, and make you feel a wee bit gross when wearing them, 100% give these a shot!I've just finished my first cycle using them and I'm never going back to disposable pads. These are comfortable, they stay in place. Super soft and fleecy material, that seems to absorb everything. I got longer between changing pads with these which was ideal for my 8 hour shift. Theres no odor at all. Zero leakage even over night, and I mean nothing! I have very heavy periods so this is a big plus. I didn't feel like I was sweating in them and they didn't crunch up like disposable ones do. They just stayed nice and flat and kept shape.I washed them all as instructed without Fabric conditioner, and they washed well.","So if you're like me, and disposible sanitary pads irritate your body, make you feel uncomfortable, and make you feel a wee bit gross when wearing them, 100% give these a shot!I've just finished my first cycle using them and I'm never going back to disposable pads.

My usual fantastic/eco pads were unavailable so thought I'd get these to tide me over. I use lots of amazon brand stuff and am very happy with it. However I'd imagine these to be size/shape of an always medium/large incontinence pad. They arrived - HUGE!! The type you'd use for elderly people 😳!!

However all this said they are remarkably comfortable and bizarrely despite the size can be worn with jeans without getting rucked up or being visible!!

I have just started using these pads. They are cheaper than what I had been using. I found them comfortable & soft larger in size to what I had been use to but overcome the size they are adequate for night time wear. Stays in place & there is no un pleasant smells which some pads can have due to their make up. Would recommend but perhaps like me I tried a few before ordering on a regular basis. I ordered X pads because they had been reduce for a while so I order extra Just ordered extra package I am pleased with these pads comfortable with item.

"Very comfortable to wear and no causes no irritation at all as this is not a fragranced product ~ thankfully. It manages to stay in place perfectly despite not having wings and is much more capable of holding pee than the usual brands are.Occasionally these do not manage to contain my full on accidents which then means either underwear change (underneath the pad gets damp if it is too much) or it is a full on trouser change. However, that would be impossible for any pad to manage to do but just wanted it to be known that if full on accidents are the main issue, then the other Amazon product which I also use would be a huge help. That is the Amazon ""adult pull up"" as I call them to my kids who also happen to be in pull ups to try to help them understand.These also work great if you happen to have heavy periods due to the nature of the product.These are excellent value for money and is significantly less than the so called leading brands. It is already very pricey having bladder issues so expensive pads on top is definitely not something that is needed!These would be ideal for people who happen to have leaks as I am unable to feel I need to go until seconds before I do and these can contain that if it isn't say, an early morning pee or a pee after drinking a lot of water, for example.The products arrive in a plain box which is impossible to tell what is inside. That is very well thought-out as most people don't want it made obvious that they are have bladder issues.These are not obvious under clothes either.","Very comfortable to wear and no causes no irritation at all as this is not a fragranced product ~ thankfully.
